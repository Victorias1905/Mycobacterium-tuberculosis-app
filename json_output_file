This study aims to \nexplore the impact of respiratory chain gene mutations on the global spread of MTBC.\n\nResults  A total of 13,402 isolates of MTBC were included in this study. The majority of the isolates (n = 6,382, 47.62%) \nbelonged to lineage 4, followed by lineage 2 (n = 5,123, 38.23%). Our findings revealed significant associations\nbetween Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of specific genes and transmission clusters. These SNPs include \nRv0087 (hycE, G178T), Rv1307 (atpH, C650T), Rv2195 (qcrA, G181C), Rv2196 (qcrB, G1250T), Rv3145 (nuoA, C35T), Rv3149 \n(nuoE, G121C), Rv3150 (nuoF, G700A), Rv3151 (nuoG, A1810G), Rv3152 (nuoH, G493A), and Rv3157 (nuoM, A1243G). \nFurthermore, our results showed that the SNPs of atpH C73G, atpA G271C, qcrA G181C, nuoJ G115A, nuoM G772A, \nand nuoN G1084T were positively correlated with cross-country transmission clades and cross-regional transmission \nclades.\n\nConclusions  Our study uncovered an association between mutations in respiratory chain genes and the \ntransmission of MTBC.

The \nMTBC  consists  of  animal-adapted  and  human-adapted \nstrains. Among the human-adapted MTBC are the Myco-\nbacterium tuberculosis sensu stricto comprising Lineages \n(L)  1–4,  7  and  8  and  Mycobacterium  africanum  com-\nprising  L5  and  L6,  L9  and  L10)  predominantly  found  in \nAfrica  [1].  In  our  study,  we  specifically  focused  on  the \nphylogeographical  distribution  of  Mycobacterium  tuber-\nculosis sensu stricto L 2 and L4. Despite the availability of \npreventive and treatment measures, TB remains a signifi-\ncant  global  public  health  concern  [2].  According  to  the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO), approximately one-\nfourth  of  the  world’s  population  is  infected  with  MTBC \n[2]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that \ninfluence the transmission of MTBC in order to develop \neffective strategies for TB control.\n\nThe respiratory chain is a critical process within bacte-\nrial cells that transfers electrons from substrates to termi-\nnal acceptors through redox reactions, generating energy. \nThe  respiratory  chain  of  MTBC,  the  causative  agent  of \ntuberculosis, mainly consists of three complexes: NADH \ndehydrogenase  complex  I,  cytochrome  c  oxidase  com-\nplex  IV,  and  respiratory  chain  enzyme  III  [3–5].  These \ncomplexes  work  together  to  facilitate  electron  transfer \nand proton pumping, ultimately resulting in the creation \nof  a  chemical  gradient  and  intracellular  ATP  synthesis. \nNADH dehydrogenase complex I receives electrons from \nNADH, a product of cellular respiration, and passes them \nto the next complex in the chain [3, 6]. Cytochrome c oxi-\ndase  complex  IV  acts  as  the  terminal  acceptor  of  elec-\ntrons, combining them with oxygen to complete the final \nstep of the respiratory chain, the reduction of oxygen to \nwater.  Respiratory  chain  enzyme  III  plays  a  critical  role \nin  electron  transfer  between  complexes  I  and  IV  while \nsimultaneously  facilitating  proton  pumping  across  the \nmembrane  [4,  5].  The  overall  process  of  electron  trans-\nfer and proton pumping leads to the establishment of an \nelectrochemical gradient across the bacterial membrane. \nThis gradient is essential for ATP synthesis as it drives the \nrotation of ATP synthase, an enzyme responsible for con-\nverting ADP into ATP. ATP, the primary energy currency \nof cells, provides the necessary energy for various cellular \nactivities  and  metabolic  processes  [7–9].  Understanding \nthe complexity of the respiratory chain in MTBC is cru-\ncial  for  unraveling  the  pathogenesis  of  tuberculosis  and \nidentifying  potential  therapeutic  targets.  Disrupting  the \nacquisition  and  utilization  mechanisms  of  the  bacterial \nrespiratory chain shows promise in inhibiting the growth \nand survival of MTBC, providing opportunities for devel-\noping  effective  anti-tuberculosis  strategies.  It  is  impor-\ntant to note that further research is needed to determine \n\nPage 2 of 14\n\nthe specific regulatory mechanisms of respiratory chain-\nrelated genes in the dissemination of MTBC. While vari-\nous gene groups may impact TB transmission, our focus \non respiratory chain genes stems from their central role \nin cellular energy production. By investigating the influ-\nence  of  mutations  in  these  genes  on  the  transmission \ndynamics  of  MTBC,  we  aim  to  gain  insights  into  the \npathogenesis of tuberculosis and identify potential inter-\nvention targets.\n\nis \n\nWhole-genome  sequencing  (WGS) \n\nincreasingly \nbeing employed to explore the transmission dynamics of \nthe MTBC [10]. In this study, we utilized WGS to exam-\nine the impact of respiratory chain gene mutations on the \nglobal transmission of the MTBC focusing on large clus-\nters and clades as indicators of transmission.\n\nMethod\nSample collection\n\nDuring  the  period  from  2011  to  2018,  a  total  of  1,550 \ncases of MTBC infection with positive culture were doc-\numented in two medical institutions in China: the Shan-\ndong  Public  Health  Clinical  Research  Center  (SPHCC) \nand the Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital (WRDH). \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  this  study  excluded  cases \nwhere MTBC culture was positive but had already been \nevaluated and treated previously.\n\nDNA extraction and sequencing\n\nWe extracted genomic DNA from a total of 1,447 isolates \nof  MTBC  using  the  Cetyltrimethylammonium  Bromide \n(CTAB)  method.  After  an  accidental  loss  of  two  iso-\nlates, genome sequencing was performed on the remain-\ning 1,445 isolates using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system. \nSubsequently,  the  generated  sequence  data  was  depos-\nited  in  the  National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Informa-\ntion (NCBI) and assigned the BioProject PRJNA1002108 \nincluded  11,957  MTBC \naccession.  In  addition,  we \ngenomes  sourced  from  published  literature  from  a \ndiverse range of geographic locations worldwide [11–19]. \nThese genomes came from 52 countries and 18 regions of \nthe world. For precise mapping of our genomes to the of \nstandard H37Rv reference genome, we utilized the BWA-\nMEM algorithm (version 0.7.17-r1188). Our analysis was \nspecifically focused on samples with a coverage rate equal \nto or exceeding 98% and a minimum depth of at least 20% \n[20].  In  summary,  this  study  involved  the  analysis  of  a \ntotal of 13,402 genomes. Please refer to Additional file 1: \nTables S1-S2 for the specific sample numbers.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis\n\nWe  conducted  variant  calling  using  Samclip  (version \n0.4.0)  and  SAMtools  (version  1.15),  followed  by  addi-\ntional  filtering  steps  to  refine  the  identified  variants. \nTo  further  filter  the  variants,  we  employed  Free  Bayes \n\nLi et al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:810 \nPage 3 of 14\n\n(version  1.3.2)  and  Bcftools  (version  1.15.1).  In  order  to \nensure  the  accuracy  of  our  analysis,  we  excluded  SNPs \nlocated  within  repeat  regions,  including  polymorphic \nGC-rich sequences in PE/PPE genes, direct repeat SNPs, \nand repeat bases identified using Tandem Repeat Finder \n(version  4.09)  and  RepeatMask  (version  4.1.2-P1)  [21, \n22].  Additionally,  SNP  annotation  was  performed  using \nSnpEff v 4.1 l, and the output was obtained utilizing the \nPython programming language [23].\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\n\nAccording to Coll et al [24], the isolates in this study were \nclassified into different lineages (Additional file 1: Tables \nS1-S2).  To  construct  the  maximum  likelihood  phylo-\ngenetic  tree,  we  utilized  the  IQ-TREE  software  package \n(version  1.6.12).  The  JC  nucleotide  substitution  model \nand gamma model of rate heterogeneity were used, with \n100  bootstrap  replicates  included  for  statistical  support \n[25].  The  resulting  tree  was  rooted  on  Mycobacterium \ncanettii CIPT140010059 as an outlier. The resulting phy-\nlogenetic  tree  was  visualized  using  iTOL  (https://itol.\nembl.de/) for better representation and interpretation.\n\nPropagation analysis\n\nWe  utilized  cluster  and  clade  analysis  to  investigate  the \ninfluence of mutations in respiratory chain genes on the \ntransmission  dynamics  of  MTBC  [26].  The  selection \nof  SNP  thresholds  for  defining  clusters  and  clades  was \nbased  on  factors  such  as  the  study  context,  geographic \nlocation,  and  the  genetic  diversity  of  the  isolates  ana-\nlyzed. From previous research, it was suggested that a dif-\nference of less than 5 SNPs indicated recent transmission, \nwhile a difference of more than 12 SNPs generally did not \nrepresent  recent  transmission  networks  [27].  However, \nwe  took  into  consideration  various  factors  that  could \naffect  the  number  of  observed  SNP  differences  between \nisolates. These factors included time lapse, acquisition of \ndrug resistance, lineage characteristics, mixed infections, \nlaboratory contamination, and variations in the molecu-\nlar  clock  of  the  tuberculosis  genome  [27].  Given  the \nwide  range  of  locations  and  time  periods  (1991–2019) \nrepresented  by  the  collected  MTBC  strains,  we  selected \na  threshold  of  12  SNPs  to  define  clusters  representing \nrecent  transmission  events  and  a  threshold  of  25  SNPs \nto  capture  broader  transmission  patterns  within  clades \n[28].  To  further  categorize  these  transmission  clades, \nwe  adopted  a  widely  used  classification  system.  Clades \nwere classified into three groups based on their size: large \n(above the 75th percentiles), medium (between the 25th \nand  75th  percentiles),  and  small  (below  the  25th  per-\ncentiles)  [29].  Specifically,  clades  comprising  two  strains \nwere classified as “small clades,” those with 3 to 14 strains \nas “medium clades,” and those with 15 or more strains as \n“large clades.”\n\nTo conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global dis-\ntribution  patterns  and  transmission  dynamics  of  MTBC \nisolates,  we  classified  them  into  two  categories:  cross-\ncountry  and  within-country  clades.  The  cross-country \nclade  is  defined  as  a  clade  containing  isolates  from  two \nor more different countries. Furthermore, based on geo-\ngraphical regions defined by the United Nations standard \nregions  (UN  M.49),  the  MTBC  isolates  were  classified \ninto  cross-regional  and  within-regional  clades.  Cross-\nregional  clades  included  isolates  from  multiple  regions. \nThe cross-regional clade is defined as a clade containing \nisolates from two or more different regions.\n\nAcquisition of respiratory chain genes\n\nOur  analysis  commenced  by  retrieving  all  genes  associ-\nated with the MTBC from the NCBI database, resulting \nin  a  comprehensive  dataset  comprising  4015  genes.  We \nspecifically  focused  on  the  H37Rv  strain  and  meticu-\nlously  filtered  the  gene  list  based  on  their  respective \norganism names, resulting in a refined set of 4009 genes. \nSubsequently, we directed our attention towards refining \nthe gene selection process with a particular emphasis on \nidentifying genes that are linked to the respiratory chain. \nThis  involved  evaluating  their  functional  descriptions \nand characteristic annotations, which successfully led to \nthe  identification  of  29  genes  directly  implicated  in  the \nrespiratory  chain.  To  identify  mutations  within  this  set \nof respiratory chain genes, we employed a detailed pipe-\nline  utilizing  snippy  (v4.6.0).  The  pipeline  encompassed \nBWA-MEM  for  sequence  alignment,  Samtools  for  sort-\ning  and  indexing,  FreeBayes  for  variant  calling,  Bcftools \nfor  quality  filtering,  and  SnpEff  for  SNP  annotation  in \ngenes  associated  with  the  respiratory  chain.  (Additional \nfile 1: Table S3).\n\nModeling and statistical analysis\n\nTo  ensure  statistical  reliability,  we  excluded  mutations \nthat were observed fewer than ten times from the analy-\nsis. The data were presented as percentages. For statistical \nanalysis,  we  employed  generalized  linear  mixed  mod-\nels (GLMM) in the R statistical language (version 4.2.3). \nAdditionally,  Python  3.7.4  with  the  Scikit-learn  library \n(Python  Software  Foundation,  USA;  Packt  Publishing, \nUK)  was  used  to  implement  random  forest  and  gradi-\nent  boosting  decision  tree  algorithms  for  further  analy-\nsis"}]}

This study aims to \nexplore the impact of respiratory chain gene mutations on the global spread of MTBC.\n\nResults  A total of 13,402 isolates of MTBC were included in this study. The majority of the isolates (n = 6,382, 47.62%) \nbelonged to lineage 4, followed by lineage 2 (n = 5,123, 38.23%).

Up until now, \nthere has been limited research on the impact of genetic \nmutations  in  the  respiratory  chain  on  the  transmission \nof MTBC. However, we have demonstrated the potential \ninfluence of genetic mutations in the respiratory chain on \nthe  transmission  of  MTBC.  Our  findings  provided  evi-\ndence for the widespread and significant role of respira-\ntory chain gene mutations in the transmission of MTBC. \n\nOur findings suggested a significant association between \nrespiratory chain gene mutations and the transmission of \nMTBC.\n\nIn this study, we made an in-depth study on the respi-\nratory  chain  of  MTBC  and  made  important  progress, \nrevealing its key role in the occurrence and development \nof tuberculosis. Our results showed that a large number \nof mutations in respiratory chain genes pose a significant \nrisk to the spread of MTBC. The atpH gene plays a sig-\nnificant role in MTBC. It is part of the respiratory chain \ncomplex  ATP  synthase,  responsible  for  catalyzing  the \n\nLi et al. BMC Genomics          (2024) 25:810  \n\nPage 11 of 14\n\nconversion  of  ADP  and  phosphate  into  ATP  within  the \ncell [30]. In our study, we identified specific mutations in \nthe atpH gene that showed associations with transmission \nclusters of MTBC. The mutation Ala217Val in atpH was \nfound to be correlated with lineage 4 transmission clus-\nters, while the mutation Leu25Val in atpH was observed \nin  cross-country  and  cross-regional  transmission  clades \nof  MTBC.  Additionally,  the  mutation  Ile422Val  in  atpH \nwas linked to cross-country transmission clades. CydA is \na  subunit  of  the  respiratory  chain  complex,  cytochrome \nbd oxidase, and it participates in the oxygen metabolism \nprocess  of  bacteria  [31].  Our  research  revealed  that  a \nmutation Ile314Ile in the cydA gene was associated with \ntransmission  clusters  of  MTBC,  lineage  4  transmission \nclusters,  cross-country  transmission  clades,  and  cross-\nregional  transmission  clades.  Although  this  mutation  is \nsynonymous,  it  may  still  impact  the  functionality  of  the \noxidase, thereby influencing the oxygen metabolism and \nphysiological  adaptation  of  MTBC  [32].  QcrA  plays  a \ncrucial  role  in  MTBC.  It  is  a  subunit  of  the  respiratory \nchain  complex,  quinol-cytochrome  c  reductase,  and \nparticipates  in  the  electron  transfer  process  of  bacteria \n[33]. This enzyme plays a key role in oxidizing quinol to \ncytochrome c within the respiratory chain. Our findings \nindicated that a mutation Glu61Gln in the qcrA gene was \nassociated with transmission clusters of MTBC, lineage 4 \ntransmission clusters, cross-country transmission clades, \nand  cross-regional  transmission  clades.  The  mutation \nin  the  qcrA  gene  may  potentially  impact  the  functional-\nity of quinol-cytochrome c reductase, thereby disrupting \nthe energy metabolism and survival capability of MTBC. \nThe  protein  encoded  by  the  nuoJ  gene  is  a  subunit  of \nNADH  dehydrogenase  complex  I,  which  participates  in \nthe  respiratory  chain  and  ATP  synthesis.  However,  lim-\nited research has been conducted on this gene. Our study \nfound  that  the  mutation  Val165Ile  of  the  nuoJ  gene  was \nassociated with transmission clusters of MTBC, lineage 4 \ntransmission clusters, cross-country transmission clades, \nand cross-regional transmission clades.\n\nIn addition, we have observed that the nuoG gene is not \nonly  associated  with  missense  mutations  but  also  with \nsynonymous  mutations  in  the  transmission  of  MTBC. \nThe  nuoG  gene  corresponds  to  a  subunit  of  NADH \ndehydrogenase  complex  I,  which  plays  a  crucial  role  in \nthe  respiratory  chain  as  an  oxidative  phosphorylation \nenzyme [34]. Specifically, the mutation Thr604Ala of the \nnuoG  gene  was  linked  to  the  transmission  clusters,  lin-\neage  4  transmission  clusters,  and  clade  size  of  MTBC, \nwhile  the  mutation  Ile474Met  was  associated  with  lin-\neage 2 transmission clusters. Our findings align with the \nresults  reported  by  Velmurugan  et  al.,  who  discovered \nthat the absence of nuoG in MTBC eliminates its ability \nto inhibit macrophage apoptosis and significantly reduces \nits virulence in mice [6]. Nevertheless, further research is \n\nrequired to elucidate the specific functionality and regu-\nlatory mechanisms of the nuoG gene in MTBC. Further-\nmore,  our  findings  corroborate  that  both  synonymous \nand  non-synonymous  mutations  could  influence  the \ntransmission  of  MTBC.  This  implied  that  synonymous \nmutations  in  respiratory  chain  genes  were  not  univer-\nsally benign, supporting prior research by Xukang Shen, \nwhich posited that synonymous mutations in yeast genes \ntended  to  be  predominantly  potent  non-neutral  muta-\ntions [9].\n\nThis  study  acknowledges  and  discusses  the  limita-\ntions that may have influenced our findings. One limita-\ntion relates to non-clustered isolates, where the absence \nof  evidence  does  not  necessarily  indicate  evidence  of \nabsence.  This  could  be  attributed  to  potential  sampling \nbias,  as  it  is  practically  impossible  to  exhaustively  sam-\nple  all  isolates  within  a  given  population.  Therefore,  the \nlimited  diagnostic  contribution  of  the  identified  muta-\ntions  could  be  partially  explained  by  this  sampling  bias. \nAdditionally, our study focused on specific variables and \nmay  not  encompass  all  possible  factors  influencing  the \nobserved  outcomes.  Other  unmeasured  or  unknown \nfactors  might  contribute  to  the  limitations  of  our  study. \nFurthermore, the generalizability of our findings may be \nconstrained  by  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  study \npopulation or sample size. Including all isolates from the \nsame  cluster  or  clade  carries  the  risk  of  overrepresent-\ning  certain  genotypes  or  lineages,  potentially  introduc-\ning  bias  into  the  statistical  results.  This  sampling  bias \nmay  impact  the  generalizability  of  our  findings  beyond \nthe studied population. The selection of isolates based on \navailable data and the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria \nemployed  may  have  introduced  biases  regarding  strain \ndistribution  and  characteristics.  It  is  crucial  to  interpret \nthe  results  within  the  context  of  these  limitations  and \npotential bias risks. They underscore the need for future \nresearch involving larger and more diverse sample sizes, \nrepresentative  sampling  strategies,  and  the  consider-\nation of additional confounding factors. Addressing these \nlimitations  will  enhance  the  reliability  and  generaliz-\nability  of  our  findings.  Another  limitation  is  the  lack  of \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  impact  of  mutations \non  the  function  of  respiratory  chain  enzymes.  While \nwe  identified  and  analyzed  the  presence  and  frequency \nof  mutations  in  respiratory  chain  genes,  further  experi-\nmental  verification  is  necessary  to  determine  the  func-\ntional  consequences  of  these  mutations  on  respiratory \nchain  enzyme  activity.

This study aims to \nexplore the impact of respiratory chain gene mutations on the global spread of MTBC.\n\nResults  A total of 13,402 isolates of MTBC were included in this study. The majority of the isolates (n = 6,382, 47.62%) \nbelonged to lineage 4, followed by lineage 2 (n = 5,123, 38.23%). Our findings revealed significant associations\n  and  evaluating  the  impact  of  both  synony-\nmous and nonsynonymous variants on enzyme function \nand  infectivity,  future  studies  can  provide  a  more  com-\nprehensive understanding of the role of respiratory chain \nmutations in infection transmission dynamics.\n\nWe fully acknowledge the limitations of not performing \ndN/dS  ratio  analysis.  Firstly,  the  reason  we  did  not  per-\nform  a  dN/dS  ratio  analysis  primarily  relates  to  method \nselection  and  data  availability.  dN/dS  ratio  analysis \nrequires  a  large  amount  of  high-quality  whole-genome \nsequence  data  to  ensure  accuracy.  However,  due  to \nresource and time constraints, our available dataset may \nnot be sufficient to support such an analysis. Additionally, \ndN/dS  ratio  analysis  requires  a  deep  understanding  of \ngene annotation and function, but our current knowledge \nof MTBC gene function remains quite limited. Secondly, \nalthough the dN/dS ratio is a commonly used parameter \nto  measure  natural  selection  pressure,  it  cannot  capture \nall the complex factors influencing the dynamics of infec-\ntion transmission. For instance, environmental pressures, \nhost  immune  responses,  and  other  factors  can  have  sig-\nnificant  impacts  during  the  infection  process,  but  these \nfactors are not directly reflected in a dN/dS ratio analy-\nsis. However, this does not mean that we have completely \nignored the role of natural selection. We have attempted \nto assess the potential impact of natural selection in other \nways,  such  as  by  analyzing  the  frequency  and  distribu-\ntion  of  gene  mutations,  and  through  detailed  discussion \nof  the  biological  effects  of  known  mutations.  Further-\nmore, we emphasize that future research, including dN/\ndS ratio analysis, is necessary for a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of the role of natural selection in infection \ntransmission.\n\nConclusion\nThe  findings  of  this  study  suggested  that  mutations  in \ngenes associated with the respiratory chain could poten-\ntially elevate the risk of MTBC transmission, underscor-\ning the importance of conducting additional research to \n\nexplore the impact of these mutations on the control and \ndissemination of MTBC. These results offered significant \ninsights that could inform the development of therapeu-\ntic interventions for tuberculosis.\n\nAbbreviations\nMTBC \nWGS \nSPHCC \nWRDH \nCTAB \nQC \nSNP \nSNPs \nNCBI \n\n Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex\n Whole-genome sequencing\n Shandong Public Health Clinical Research Center\n Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital\n Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide\n Quality control\n Single nucleotide polymorphism\n Single nucleotide polymorphisms\n National Center for Biotechnology Information\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12864-024-10726-z.\n\nSupplementary Material 1: Table S1 Information of 1445 isolates of Myco-\nbacterium tuberculosis.\n\nSupplementary Material 2: Table S2 Information of 11957 isolates of Myco-\nbacterium tuberculosis.\n\nSupplementary Material 3: Table S3 Information of respiratory chain gene \nmutations.\n\nSupplementary Material 4: Table S4 Generalized linear mixed model analy-\nsis on clustered and non-clustered isolates.\n\nSupplementary Material 5: Table S5 Important scores of each feature of \nvarious models in cluster.\n\nSupplementary Material 6: Table S6 The performance of various models for \ndiscriminating clustered isolates from non-clustered isolates in lineage2 \ncohort.\n\nSupplementary Material 7: Table S7 Important scores of each feature in \nvarious models within the lineage 2 clusters.\n\nSupplementary Material 8: Table S8 The performance of various models for \ndiscriminating clustered isolates from non-clustered isolates in lineage4 \ncohort.\n\nSupplementary Material 9: Table S9 Important scores of each feature in \nvarious models within the lineage 4 clusters.\n\nSupplementary Material 10: Table S10 Generalized linear mixed model \nanalysis on cross-country transmission clades.\n\nSupplementary Material 11: Table S11 The performance of various models \nfor discriminating cross-country from non-cross-country transmission \nclades.\n\nSupplementary Material 12: Table S12 Important scores of each feature in \nvarious models within the cross-country transmission clades.\n\nSupplementary Material 13: Table S13 Generalized linear mixed model \nanalysis on cross-regional transmission clades.\n\nSupplementary Material 14: Table S14 The performance of various models \nfor discriminating cross-regional from non-cross-regional transmission \nclades.\n\nSupplementary Material 15: Table S15 Important scores of each feature in \nvarious models within the cross-regional transmission clades. \n\nSupplementary Material 16: Table S16 Correlation analysis between respi-\nratory chain gene mutations and clade size.\n\nSupplementary Material 17: Fig. S1 Phylogenetic tree for the Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis isolates of lineage4.2.

Identifying critical regions in these ESX-1–related proteins could provide \n\npreventive or therapeutic targets for Mtb infection, the game changer needed for tuberculosis \n\ncontrol. We analysed a compendium of whole genome sequences of clinical Mtb isolates from \n\nall lineages from >32,000 patients and identified single nucleotide variations (SNVs). When \n\nmutations  corresponding  to  all  non-synonymous  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (nSNPs) \n\nwere mapped  on structural  models of the ESX-1 proteins, fully conserved regions emerged. \n\nSome could be assigned to known quaternary structures, whereas others could be predicted to \n\nbe involved in yet-to-be-discovered interactions. Some mutants had clonally expanded (found \n\nin >1% of the isolates): these mutants were mostly located at the surface of globular domains, \n\nremote  from  known  intra-  and  inter-molecular  protein–protein  interactions.  Fully  conserved \n\nintrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins were found, suggesting that these regions are \n\ncrucial for the pathogenicity of the Mtbc. Altogether, our findings highlight fully conserved \n\nregions  of  proteins  as  attractive  vaccine  antigens  and  drug  targets  to  control  Mtb  virulence. \n\nExtending  this  approach  to  the  whole  Mtb  genome  as  well  as  other  microorganisms  will \n\nenhance vaccine development for various pathogens. \n\nIntroduction \n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans and other mammals. \n\nThis remarkably monomorphic pathogen shares 99.9% nucleotide similarity and identical 16S \n\nrRNA in its larger Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (Mtbc), unlike diversity seen in other \n\nbacteria1,  2,  3,  4.  In  the  past  decades,  extensive  research  has  been  done  to  clarify  the  precise \n\nvirulence mechanisms of the Mtbc. The protein ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target, \n\nalso known as EsxA) was identified as its main secreted virulence factor5, 6, associated with the \n\nprotein  EsxB.  The  secreted  heterodimer  is  critical  for  Mtbc  virulence  through  its  cytolytic \n\nactivity7,  8,  9,  10.  The  deletion  of  the  esxA-containing  chromosomal  region  RD1  (Region  of \n\nDifference 1) in M. bovis of the Calmette-Guérin (BCG) strain rendered this century-old vaccine \n\navirulent11.  Similarly,  deletion  of  RD1  in  Mtb  caused  decreased  virulence  similar  to  that  of \n\nBCG in vitro12. M. microti spontaneously lost a similar RD1 region making it avirulent. RD1 \n\n2 \n\n \n \n\ncontains genes of the ESAT-6 secretion system 1, ESX-111, 13. ESX-1 is a member of the type \n\nVII secretion systems (T7SS) family and is essential for full virulence in all Mtbc lineages (L1–\n\nL8) as well as in the closely related pathogenic M. marinum, M. kansasii14, and M. leprae15. \n\nThe ESX-1 genes of interest (GOI) are mainly located within the extended RD1 locus, but also \n\ninclude multiple genes across different loci and are required for the building, the functioning \n\nand  the  regulation  of  ESX-1,  the  transport  of  virulence  factors,  and  their  membrane  lysis \n\nactivity. The ESX-1 GOI encodes 34 proteins (ESX-1–related proteins) that can be divided into \n\nfour functional categories: 7 substrates (products that are secreted during virulence), 6 inner-\n\nmembrane  core  components  (proteins  part  of  the  secretion  machinery),  9  regulators \n\n(transcription factors), and 12 peripherals (exact function yet to be determined); the mechanism \n\nby which the substrates translocate through the mycobacterial outer membrane has not been \n\nsolved yet and the proteins potentially involved in that step have not been identified.  \n\nThe structure of the ESX-1 inner core complex has not been solved yet; however, those \n\nof ESX-316 and ESX-517 have been deciphered and atomic models for a few ESX proteins (in \n\nisolation  or  as  part  of  a  complex)  have  also  been  experimentally  solved.  Accurate  structure \n\nprediction  of  single  proteins  has  become  available  through  artificial  intelligence  (AI) \n\ntechniques18,  19  and  the  obtained  models  generally  compare  well  to  experimental  ones,  thus \n\nallowing  for  large  structural  bioinformatics  screens  in  silico.  Using  AI-generated  protein \n\nmodels  also  allows  for  the  building  of  higher-order  protein  complexes  together  with \n\nhomologous templates such as the ESX-3 and ESX-5 core machineries in the case of ESX-1, \n\nthus allowing for the exploration of the inter-molecular interfaces within. \n\nDespite their high genomic similarity, Mtbc lineages (L) differ significantly in the host \n\nimmune response they elicit, host tropism, phenotypes, drug resistance, and transmissibility20, \n\n21, 22, 23. So far, most research on the ESX-1 machinery has focused on the Mtbc L2 and L4 \n\nbecause  of  their  widespread  geographic  range  and  the  availability  of  laboratory-adapted \n\nreference strains such as H37Rv (L4) and HN878 (L2). Thus, our knowledge on the genomic \n\ndifferences and convergence in the ESX-1 genes across the Mtbc is limited. \n\nTo  obtain  a  deeper  understanding  of  virulence  across  Mtbc,  we  generated  single \n\nnucleotide variation (SNV) and polymorphism (SNP, both synonymous and non-synonymous) \n\ncatalogues found in the ESX-1 GOI, for Mtbc lineages (L1–L6) of human importance. We used \n\nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) data from >32,000 publicly available clinical isolates. First, \n\nwe provide evidence illustrating the variation tolerance of the ESX-1 GOI, confirming that it is \n\nthe  most  SNV-dense  group  of  genes  within  the  Mtb  genome24.  Next,  we  identified  several \n\ngenomic regions including variants that arose independently under positive selection as done \n\n3 \n\n \n \n\nby Vargas et al.24. We then examined the amino-acid locations that bear abundant SNV counts. \n\nIn 34 ESX-1 genes, only 21 nSNPs were found in more than 1% of the isolates: given their \n\nextensive  human  to  human  passage,  we  considered  fully  functional.  None  of  these  nSNPs \n\nresulted  from  convergence  but  were  due  to  either  opportunistic  sampling  of  the  dataset  or \n\noccurring in ancestral lineages. The data also revealed which parts of the 34 proteins are fully \n\nconserved. We mapped all SNVs onto each of the experimental and predicted ESX-1 proteins’ \n\nstructural  models  and  inspected  their  placement.  Varying  sizes  of  conserved  regions  were \n\nfound, and some proteins showed clear polarity in their nSNP distribution. We then scrutinised \n\nsome essential motifs (such as Walker motifs25, secretion signals, SS-bonds, post translational \n\nmodification sites), and identified less than 0.01% of isolates bearing SNVs in those locations. \n\nNext, we analysed predicted intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within our set of proteins, \n\nfinding  two  putative  long  stretches  that  are  fully  conserved,  and  discussed  their  potential \n\nessential  role  in  immunological  recognition.  Finally,  we  compared  known  and  predicted \n\nquaternary  structures,  correlated  interaction  interfaces  with  SNV  distribution  maps,  and \n\nexperimentally  validated  one  unexpected  mutation  on  the  interaction  interface  of  EsxA  and \n\nEsxB, which still permits complex formation. Combined, our findings highlight new targets for \n\ninterfering with Mtbc virulence. \n\nResults \n\nConsolidating SNPs for ESX-1 GOI \n\nA collection of 32,399 unique Mtbc isolates, including clinical Mtbc isolates24 L1–L6 \n\n(NCBI), L726, as well as M. bovis (unpublished data), was collated (Figure 1, Supplementary \n\nFigure 1). The presence of an ESX-1 machinery and its substrates, essential to Mtb virulence, \n\nin virulent clinical isolates from human TB patients may be considered as positively selected \n\nstrains for virulence in a genetic selection screen. For the ESX-1 GOI, we examined 34 genes \n\nencoding 34 proteins with a total of 11,167 amino acids, of which 8616 displayed an SNV: \n\n2742  synonymous  mutation  sites  (sSNPs)  and  5874  nSNPs.  More  than  half  (52%)  of  the \n\nencoded amino acids had at least one nSNP. Supplementary Figures 2–5 visualise the SNVs \n\nmapped on the AlphaFold-predicted structures for each of the 34 ESX-1 GOI. \n\nConverging evolution \n\nFrom convergence analysis, two silent sSNPs in espI in four independent lineages (L1, \n\nL4, L3, and L8), in a total of ten unrelated clinical isolates were identified and confirmed by \n\n4 \n\n \n\nSanger sequencing (Supplementary Figure 6; Supplementary Table 2); these sSNPs featured a \n\n6 cytosine repeat at codons 134–135. In cancer, this type of motif has been linked to changes \n\nin methylation27. Long PacBio reads could provide information about whether these mutations \n\naffect the methylation state of ESX-1.  \n\nConservation on 3D level \n\nWe mapped all nSNPs onto each of the known or predicted 3D structural models and \n\ninspected their spatial distribution. Varying sizes of conserved regions were found, as shown \n\nby the dominant blue colour of the predicted protein structures (Supplementary Figures 2–5). \n\nSome  proteins  showed  clear  polarity:  for  example,  nSNPS  of  the  regulators  WhiB6,  PhoR, \n\nPhoP, DevR, MprA and MprB accumulated on one side of their surface, while the opposite side \n\nshowed no nSNP (Supplementary Figure 2). \n\nComparing the prevalence of nSNPs across the 34 ESX-1 GOI, we found that WhiB6 \n\n(65.2%) and PhoR (54.2%) as well as two members of the ESX-1 inner membrane core complex \n\nEccB1  (54.4%)  and  EccE1  (53.8%)  had  the  highest  percentage  of  amino  acid  changes.  In \n\ncomparison,  the  regulator  DevR  was  most  conserved,  with  only  13.5%  of  its  amino  acids \n\nshowing any mutation, and 98% of its nSNPs occurring at a single amino acid position (see \n\nnext section). This trend of clustered nSNPs to one position was also observed for esxB (96%), \n\nPE34 (99%), espA (91%), mprB (94%), mprA (83%), espH (78%), espE (77%), and espL (69%) \n\n(Supplementary Figures 7-10). \n\nHotspots in ESX-1 GOI \n\nAfter excluding the 2 polymorphisms in espI due to convergent evolution, we identified \n\n78% of the nSNPs in so-called hotspots (in which the same mutation was found in over 1% of \n\nthe  clinical  isolates  (n>300),  reflecting  a  phylogenetically  more  ‘basal’  polymorphism  with \n\nclonal expansion. We identified 21 hotspots (Figure 2), in 14 of the 34 ESX-1 GOI, involving \n\nall lineages (Supplementary Table 3). Only 4 proteins showed more than 1 hotspot (PPE68, \n\nEccD1, EccE1, and EspK), while 9 showed each a single hotspot (PhoR, MprA, MrpB, DevR, \n\nEspA, EspE, EccB1, EsxB, EspH, and EspB). The two most abundant nSNPs were excluded as \n\nhotspots  (T192I  in  EspA  and  E99*  in  PE35)  since  they  included  almost  the  entire  dataset, \n\nsuggesting those polymorphisms appeared in the H37Rv reference strain instead; the L339H \n\nMprB  variant  appeared  in  half  the  dataset.  Hotspots  occurred  in  all  protein  categories:  we \n\nidentified  them  in  4  regulators,  3  peripherals,  4  substrates  and  3  core  components.  Upon \n\nmapping the hotspots onto the structural models, we found them predominantly located on the \n\n5 \n\n \n \n\nsurface of the proteins, including both polar and apolar residues (Figure 2). Visual inspection \n\nof the experimental as well as predicted protein structures of these 14 proteins and 21 hotspots \n\nshowed very few polar and H-bond interactions of the hotspot side chains within the protein \n\nitself (data not shown).  \n\nSince the effectors EsxA and EsxB are known to assemble into an heterodimer prior to \n\nits secretion by the ESX-1 system, we investigated the most prevalent EsxB variant E68K as it \n\ninvolves a residue buried in the interface with EsxA28, 29, and determined how it affected the \n\nassembly. We expressed and purified the mutant protein and showed an unharmed interaction \n\nwith  EsxA  (Figure  3),  confirming  earlier  predictions  by  molecular  modelling  that  the  E68K \n\nmutation would have minimal impact on the interface between EsxB and EsxA. \n\nEssential motifs and binding interfaces regions \n\nNext, we analysed the presence of nSNPs in the two motifs known to be essential for \n\nsecretion in the substrates and peripheral proteins: WxG and YxxxD/E. Overall, these secretion \n\nmotifs were found to be highly conserved. Only nine nSNPs were found at the tryptophan and \n\nfour at the glycine sites of the WxG motif, whilst for the YxxxD/E motif thirteen nSNPs and \n\ntwo were identified at the tyrosine and aspartic acid sites, respectively.  \n\nSome of the ESX-1 core components contain ATPase domains, the hydrolysis of which \n\npowers  the  secretion  of  the  ESX-1  substrates  through  the  mycobacterial  membranes.  These \n\ndomains  require  the  presence  of  Walker  motifs  for  the  proper  binding  and  hydrolysis  of \n\nnucleotides. Thus, we analysed whether nSNPs occurred in these motifs. The Walker A motif, \n\nalso  called  the  “P-loop”  for  its  phosphate-binding  loop,  exhibits  the  classical  pattern \n\n(G/A)xxxxGK(T/S)30. Our data show a total number of 6 nSNPs within this motif for the total \n\nof three ATPase domains found in"}]}

The Walker B motif (hhhhD, where h is any hydrophobic \n\nresidue) is fully conserved in all three proteins. The peripheral protein EspI harbours another \n\nP-loop  NTPase  domain;  its  role  in  down-regulating  ESX-1-mediated  secretion  when  Mtb \n\ncellular ATP levels are low has been established31 and a binding site of moderate affinity to \n\nATP has been identified within its Walker A motif32. In EspI, this motif is well conserved with \n\nonly 6 nSNPs and the essential ATP-binding residue Lys425 is unaltered. \n\nThe core membrane component (e.g., the secretion machine) of ESX-1 is critical for the \n\nvirulence  of  the  bacteria  and  represents  an  important  target  for  the  development  of  new \n\nantitubercular agents. It is built from multiple copies of four ESX conserved components (Ecc) \n\nnamed EccB, EccC, and EccD, EccE, and is stabilised by the protease MycP1, resulting in a \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n\nlarge ~1500 kDa particle. Therefore, we looked for SNP trends in the ESX-1 inner membrane \n\ncore complex. Because no experimental structure of this complex has been elucidated to date, \n\nwe modelled it as a trimer of protomer dimers and mapped the identified SNVs onto it. Our \n\ndataset revealed a large overall number of mutations within each of its components: 5923 in \n\nEccB1, 2679 in EccCa1, 3614 in EccCb1, 6760 in EccD1, 7722 in EccE1, and 1148 in MycP1 \n\n(total of 27,846 in the five proteins combined). No obvious trend was found in terms of nSNP \n\nclustering nor conservation (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 10) \n\nFinally,  we  analysed  post-translational  modification  sites,  allowing  for  glycosylation \n\nand phosphorylation, that were shown to play a significant role in Mtb adaptive processes. A \n\nrecent study mapped glycoproteomic patterns of clinical isolates of Mtb33. Consequently, we \n\nhoned in on the 34 ESX-1 GOI containing 27 glycosylation sites in total. The majority of sites \n\n(18/27) did not harbour nSNPs; the other 9 sites counted only 31 nSNPs in >32,000 isolates \n\n(0.01%) (Supplementary Table 6). Moreover, complete conservation (0 nSNP) was observed in \n\nthe phosphorylation sites for EspJ (Ser70)34 and the transcription regulators PhoR (His259)35, \n\nMprB (His249)36. Together, these data demonstrate that functional regions essential to ESX-1 \n\nfunction are largely conserved within the set of 34 ESX-1 GOI. \n\nIntrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) \n\nThe  predicted  AlphaFold  structural  models  contain  regions  of  low  and  very  low \n\nconfidence scores (respectively, <70 and <50). The percentage of low-confidence regions varies \n\nfor  different  species  and  is  relatively  small  for  bacterial  proteomes  such  as  M.  tuberculosis \n\n(13.29%)37. We analysed whether these regions of low confidence in the proteins encoded by \n\nthe ESX-1 GOI reflect intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)38, which tend to be hydrophilic \n\nunstructured protein structures thought to be disproportionately involved in interactions. Fifteen \n\nof the 34 ESX-1 GOI proteins contained at least one IDR, defined in this study by both a low \n\npredicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) confidence score and a high IDR prediction \n\nscore39  (Supplementary  Figures  7–10,  Supplementary  Table  5);  to  filter  out  flexible  loops \n\nconnecting folded domains, stretches containing a minimum of 16 amino acids were kept. Out \n\nof those fifteen IDR-containing proteins, seven substrates (PPE68, EspB) and peripheral ones \n\n(EspA,  EspE,  EspI,  EspJ  and  EspK)  contain  large  IDR  stretches  (between  ~70  and  ~290 \n\nresidues). By quantifying the relative SNV and nSNP content of those regions, we further split \n\nthem into sub-regions of high and low polymorphism. As such, we identified a single conserved \n\n(~11% SNV) IDR for EspK, and polymorphic-only IDRs for EspA, EspJ and PPE68; EspE, \n\nEspI and EspB displayed both kinds (Figure 4). IDRs harbouring no nSNPs (in EspI, EspB) \n\n7 \n\n \n\nsuggest  a  conserved  role  for  these  regions,  as  exemplified  by  the  entirely  nSNP-free  IDR \n\nidentified in EspB (residues 262–335) between the folded N-terminal domain (1-269) and the \n\nMycP1 cleavage site (Ala358/Ser35940) that promotes the oligomerisation of the protein41, 42. \n\nQuaternary structures \n\nTo gain insight into the fidelity of interfaces for protein complexes utilised by the Type \n\nVII  Secretion  System  (T7SS)  in  pathogenic  mycobacteria,  we  conducted  a  thorough \n\nexamination  of  nSNPs  within  the  context  of  quaternary  structures.  We  employed  the  PISA \n\ninterface tool43 to scrutinise known complex interfaces, using a BSA score >0 as an indicator \n\nof  predicted  interaction  sites.  For  every  complex  interface  in  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis \n\n(Mtb), we quantified the number of nSNPs associated with each interacting residue. \n\nTo begin, we identified nSNPs within experimentally verified regions where multiple \n\nESX-1  substrates  have  been  documented  to  interact28,  41,  44,  45,  46.  Focusing  on  the  primary \n\nsubstrate complex transported by the ESX-1 system, we emphasise the conservation within the \n\ninteraction sites between EsxA and EsxB. Within these sites, 19 amino acids participate in their \n\ninteraction. Remarkably, only two interacting residues from each protein exhibited counts of 2-\n\n3 detected nSNPs at each position. To put this into perspective, these SNP occurrences were \n\nobserved  in  just  nine  isolates  out  of  a  pool  exceeding  32,000  (as  detailed  in  Supplementary \n\nTable 7), with a notable hotspot nSNP located at EsxB (E68K, 2478 nSNPs). \n\nWhen we focused our analysis on the self-interactions of EspB and PhoR oligomeres, \n\nwe discovered fewer than 50 nSNPs in less than 25% of the interacting residues (as detailed in \n\nSupplementary  Tables  8–9).  Moreover,  within  the  15  residues  involved  in  the  biologically \n\nvalidated interaction between EspK and EspB, only 5 residues exhibited nSNPs (with counts \n\nranging from 1 to 15), while the remaining 10 residues showed no nSNPs across the pool of \n\nanalysed genomes. This high level of conservation in the residues mediating this interaction \n\nemphases the stability and fidelity of the EspK–EspB complex (as shown in Supplementary \n\nTable 10). \n\nNext,  we  turned  our  attention  to  regions  of  DNA–protein  interaction,  specifically \n\nfocusing on regulators EspR and PhoP (as depicted in Figure 5). Remarkably, we identified \n\ncomplete  conservation  in  all  11  interaction  sites,  comprising  7  residues  in  the  PhoP–DNA \n\ninteraction and 4 residues in the EspR–DNA interaction (as detailed in Supplementary Tables \n\n11–12). This conservation strongly signifies the functional importance of these interaction sites \n\nfor precise gene regulation within the context of Mtb's virulence mechanisms. \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n\nLastly, we analysed the conservation of the cysteines, present in 22 of the 34 ESX-1 \n\nproteins  (Supplementary  Table  13):  these  rare,  highly  reactive  residues  play  crucial  roles  in \n\nmodulating intra- and intermolecular protein stability. We examined the cysteines involved in \n\nthe  formation  of  disulfide  bonds  in  the  periplasmic  domain  of  the  core  components  EccB1 \n\n(Cys150-Cys345),  MycP1  (Cys49-Cys118,  Cys204-Cys242)  and  the  secreted  peripheral \n\nprotein  EspE  (Cys114-Cys170):  a  single  nSNP  was  identified  within  the  disulfide  bridge  of \n\nEccB1.  We  also  inspected  the  cysteines  involved  in  the  probable  homo-  or  hetero-\n\nmultimerisation  of  the  secreted  peripheral  components  EspA,  C,  D  (Cys138,  Cys48  and \n\nCys174, respectively): EspA only harboured nSNPs at that position, in the form of a mutation \n\nhotspot (640 nSNPs). Mutation of this position has been linked to lack of dimerisation of EspA \n\nand  a  general  decrease  in  virulence  but  is  not  associated  with  a  loss  of  ESX-1-mediated \n\nsecretion (ref), highlighting the probable role of EspA in the correct delivery of the virulence \n\nfactors  to  the  host.  Regarding  cytoplasmic  components,  the  reducing  conditions  imposed \n\nintracellularly do not favour the formation of such disulfide bridges; regardless we investigated \n\nthe  putative  one  of  DevR  (Cys66-Cys78)  and  found  it  totally  conserved  in  our  samples.  In \n\ngeneral, the cysteines belonging to the cytosolic components are generally well conserved (11 \n\nor less nSNPs), except for Cys8 of EspM (25 nSNPs), Cys729 of EspK (20242 nSNPs) and \n\nCys53  of  WhiB6  (76  nSNPs).  The  latter  may  form  a  [4Fe-4S]  cluster  (Pfam:  PF02467)  - \n\ntogether with Cys34, Cys56 and Cys62 - seemingly involved in sensing the redox conditions \n\nwithin the mycobacterial cytosol and essential in down-regulating the secretion of EsxA and \n\nEsxB during innate immune response to mycobacterial infection47. The general lack of nSNPs \n\ndetected at the cysteine positions underscores the critical significance of their conservation for \n\nthe proper activity of ESX-1, at both structural and functional levels. \n\nDiscussion \n\nThe  Mtbc  genome  is  very  conserved  between  lineages  and  species.  Over  a  ~4.4  Mb \n\ngenome,  we  identified  a  grand  total  of  ~800,000  SNVs  (positions,  ~18%  of  the  genome) \n\nrepresenting  nSNPs  over  the  32,399  isolates,  of  which  half  were  singletons  (a  single  nSNP \n\nidentified per SNV). In comparison, the ESX-1 GOI display an average of 13 ± 3.7% SNVs \n\n(range 4–21%), indicating those 34 genes undergo different selection pressures. Within the 34 \n\nGOI, the six most mutated genes encoding EccB1, EccD1, EspJ, PhoR, Rv3613c and WhiB6 \n\n(all with >50% of mutated amino-acid positions) may be under a stronger positive selection \n\n9 \n\n \n \n\npressure than the other 28 genes. Co-evolution analyses may reveal new interaction partners for \n\nthese proteins. Despite clonal expansion being the major force behind the spreading of new Mtb \n\nvariants48, the maximum nSNPs counts for ESX-1 proteins EspC and EsxA are still fairly low \n\n(13 and 17, respectively) and the SNVs identified in these genes are mostly singletons; this \n\nmight be related to their essential role in Mtb’s parasitic lifestyle, with their respective genes \n\nundergoing a strong negative selection.  \n\nThe core complex proteins exhibited the highest degree of variation as a group within \n\nthe ESX-1 proteins. As these mutations were not detrimental to the virulence of Mtbc in vivo, \n\nwe can conclude those did not alter the structural integrity of the machinery nor the interactions \n\nbetween the different components sustaining its function. While the structural integrity of the \n\nmachinery may not be easily compromised by single point mutations, the interactions between \n\nthe different partners of this intricate complex might be disrupted. However, it must be noted \n\nthat the disulfide-bridge-forming cysteines showed a very high degree of conservation (i.e. a \n\nsingle  nSNP  identified  over  ten  positions)  that  underscores  the  importance  of  maintaining \n\nstructural integrity for the components involved. The other cysteines in ESX-1 were more prone \n\nto  mutations  (55%  SNVs  over  47  positions)  as  exemplified  by  the  ones  found  in  the  global \n\nregulator WhiB6: we identified mutants at each position, four of which being involved in the \n\nformation  of  a  putative  iron-sulfur  cluster  4Fe:4S.  This  redox-reactive  cluster  is  heavily \n\ninvolved in the regulation of ESX-1-mediated virulence: M. marinum mutant exhibited reduced \n\nESX-1-mediated, contact-dependent hemolysis in vitro, concomitant to reduced secretion levels \n\nof EsxA and EsxB47. A detailed analysis of the 89 mutants identified in this study may help \n\nunveil new regulation networks involved in maintaining virulence in those isolates. As well, \n\nco-evolution network analyses may help in identifying mutation pairs responsible for intra- and \n\ninter-molecular  epistasis  involved  in  stabilising  the  various  variants  at  other  positions.  An \n\nexperimentally determined structure of the ESX-1 inner membrane complex would also provide \n\na suitable framework for a detailed analysis of these mutations.  \n\nOur analyses revealed ample sequence conservation in the known interaction and active \n\nsites of ESX-1 proteins, such as the ATPase domains of the core complex. Most proteins have \n\nsignature  sequences  or  motifs  that  are  characteristic  of  protein  families  and  represent  an \n\nimportant  feature  in  the  protein  structure  or  function.  The  Walker  B  motifs  were  indeed \n\nconserved in the ESX-1 ATPases. It is noteworthy that even the ATPase 2 and 3 domains of \n\nEccCb1 are relatively conserved even though these domains may not be catalytically active49, \n\nas suggested by the orientation of the involved residues in the experimental Thermomonospora \n\ncurvata EccC structural model, and the discovery of ATP molecules bound to these domains49. \n\n10 \n\n \n\nHowever, those observations may not be relevant to EccCb proteins of the Mtbc strains as we \n\nhave evidence of ATPase activity in EccCb1 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (unpublished data). \n\nMoreover,  several  putative  sites  for  post-translational  glycosylation  and  phosphorylation \n\nidentified  in  the  ESX-1-associated  proteins  displayed  considerate  conservation,  thus \n\nhighlighting their relevance as diagnostics or drug and vaccine targets. \n\nAdditionally, some IDRs also proved to be highly conserved, harbouring only a few \n\nnSNPs.  While  several  IDP-specialised  prediction  tools  have  been  developed  in  the  past  two \n\ndecades,  AlphaFold  has  been  surprisingly  efficient  at  identifying  IDRs  (long  amino-acid \n\nstretches  exhibiting  low  pLDDT  confidence  score)50.  We  located  a  large  proportion  of  such \n\nputative  IDRs  in  15  ESX-1  proteins,  in  which  four  substrates/peripheral  proteins  displayed \n\nhighly conserved, long amino-acid IDR stretches. The functions of IDRs are not tied to their \n\nproper spatial folding, but rather to their lack of. These natively unfolded proteins may undergo \n\npartial conformational arrangement upon binding of specific ligands (n"}]}

This  high  conservation  level  implies  an  essential  nature  of  these  regions  for  the \n\nintracellular lifestyle of parasitic Mtb and – together with their secreted nature – of their possible \n\ninvolvement with host factors. In addition, a strong immuno-modulator role can specifically be \n\nattributed to the IDRs encoded by the proteins of the PE/PPE/PE_PGRS families: those low \n\ncomplexity regions have been shown to be prone to accumulate polymorphisms and may act as \n\ndecoy antigens, thus helping Mtb to evade immune surveillance by the host51. The different \n\nlevels  of  conservation  observed  for  the  different  IDRs  identified  within  the  peripheral  and \n\nsecreted substrates of the ESX-1 machinery imply those regions may fulfil different roles, with \n\nthe  polymorphic  IDRs  acting  on  immune  evasion,  whilst  the  highly  conserved  ones  assume \n\nfunctions  essential  to  the  survival  and  pathogenesis  of  Mtb,  probably  involving  interactions \n\nwith  some  host  factors  that  may  not  allow  for  molecular  epistasis  between  the  host  and  its \n\nparasite. This is perfectly exemplified by EspB's first IDR region (amino-acids ~260-to-340) \n\nthat  is  thought  to  interact  with  phosphatidic  acid  (PA),  and  to  a  lesser  extend  to \n\nphosphatidylserine (PS)52: those phospholipids are abundant in the phagosome membrane and \n\nare involved in its maturation into bacteria-killing phagolysosomes. A major role of EspB in \n\nMtb virulence resides in delaying the phagosome maturation and it has been proposed that the \n\nunstructured  residues  following  the  folded  N-terminal  domain  partially  fold  to  bind  on  the \n\nsurface of biological membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids such as PA and \n\nPS thus interfering with their trafficking41, 53. The lack of nSNPs within that first EspB IDR \n\nsupports  this  hypothesis,  showing  its  essential  role  in  Mtb  virulence.  The  identification  and \n\n11 \n\n \n \n\ncharacterisation of other putative IDR-interacting host factors may require the use of tailored \n\nexperimental strategies, such as microscopic co-localization of the interacting IDRs with the \n\nhost’s ultrastructures, the direct pulldown of those factors from host cellular extracts using the \n\nIDRs of interest as baits, or the use of microarray screens. \n\nIn contrast to conserved regions, mutation hotspots seem to occur mostly at places on \n\nthe protein surface for which no interactions have been reported so far. The observed clustering \n\nof  nSNPs  to  a  single  amino  acid  was  not  surprising  (Figure  2),  as  surface  areas  (where  no \n\ninteractions occur) are known to be prone to polymorphisms. The hotspots suggest that these \n\nregions can vary without functional consequence, and thus have no evolutionary pressure to \n\nremain stable.  \n\nOverall,  our  analysis  of  nSNP  counts  in  specific  interactions  and  post-translational \n\nmodification  sites  within  the  ESX-1  genes  of  Mtb  provides  valuable  insights  into  the \n\nconservation  and  genetic  diversity  within  these  critical  protein–protein  and  protein–DNA \n\ninterfaces. These findings contribute to our understanding of the functional significance of these \n\ninteractions and their potential implications for Mtb's pathogenicity. Moreover, we showed here \n\nthe potential of this approach to identify clinically relevant molecular targets in the presence of \n\nboth highly conserved IDRs and motifs essential to the virulence, that should be further taken \n\nup by the Mtb community as potential targets for new vaccines. In this study, the use of a limited \n\nnumber of sequenced genomes from clinical isolates, relative to the size of Mtb genome, did \n\nnot allow for a true identification of essential protein regions at amino-acid resolution, however \n\nit can be expected that the wider adoption of WGS as a diagnostics tool will soon allow the \n\ngathering  of  sufficient  data  to  reach  this  goal  and  better  understand  the  dynamics  of  Mtb \n\nvirulence outside the laboratory. \n\nMethods \n\nWhole genome sequencing (WSG) and phylogenetic analysis of 971 clinical isolates \n\nA total of 971 genomes of clinical isolates from the Mtbc (n=965; L1–L8) and from M. \n\nbovis (n=6) were included, from Bangladesh and Gambia54, 55, 56. We used this data set as the \n\ninitial backbone phylogeny for the rest of the analysis. The semi-automated Mtbseq pipeline \n\nwas used for reads mapping and variant detection57. The output of Mtbseq was used to generate \n\nan SNP alignment using an in-house Python script (https://github.com/alxndravc/ESX-1-MS). \n\nBased on this SNP alignment, a maximum likelihood tree was built using RaxML-NG58 with a \n\nGTR + CAT model of evolution and 100 bootstraps; M. canettii was added as an outgroup. The \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n\ndifferent phylogenetic lineages were visualised using the online interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) \n\ntool59. \n\nPhylogenetic analysis of 31,428 publicly available Mtbc isolates \n\nWe used a SNP barcode60 to type a collection of 31,428 WGS Mtbc isolates downloaded \n\nfrom NCBI into Mtbc lineage and sub-lineage. We excluded isolates that were missing 10% of \n\nSNP sites, were not typed as belonging to Mtbc L1–6 or were typed as L4 but were not typed \n\nfurther with an L4 sub-lineage. We split the 31,428 isolates into eight groups based on genetic \n\nsimilarity, five groups corresponding to global L1, L2, L3, L5, L6 and three groups for lineage \n\n4 (i.e., L4.1.12). To generate phylogenies for each of these groups, we first merged VCF files \n\nof the isolates in each group with bcftools61. We then removed repetitive, antibiotic resistance, \n\nand  low-coverage  regions60.  We  generated  a  multi-sequence  FASTA  alignment  from  the \n\nmerged VCF file with vcf2phylip (version 1.5). Finally, we constructed the phylogenetic trees \n\nfor each group with IQ-TREE 1.6.1262: we used the mset option to restrict model selection to \n\nGTR  +  CAT  models  and  selected  the  GTR+F+I+R  model  for  the  six  isolate  groups \n\ncorresponding  to  L1–L4  and  implemented  the  automatic  model  selection  with  ModelFinder \n\nPlus63 for the isolate groups corresponding to L5 and L6. \n\nSNP catalogue \n\nAn in-house Python script was used to count the unique SNPs present within each isolate \n\ngroup (stratified by global lineage) within the ESX-1 GOI (https://github.com/alxndravc/ESX-\n\n1-MS). To calculate SNP frequency per 1 kb, the number of unique SNP locations per gene \n\nwere multiplied by 1000 bp and divided by their respective gene length. The same methodology \n\nwas  used  on  the  31,000  WGS  isolates  from  NCBI.  The  genes  were  divided  into  4  groups: \n\nmachinery, substrates, regulatory, and peripheral (i.e., genes not belonging to any of the other \n\nthree categories) (Supplementary Table 1).  \n\nSNPPar analysis homoplasy \n\nThe resulting phylogenetic tree from the 971 clinical isolates was used in SNPPar along \n\nwith  the  SNP  dataset  to  obtain  the  mutation  events  across  all  Mtbc  lineages.  To  screen  for \n\nconvergent SNP sites in the alignment, SNPPar was used. Based on the provided phylogenetic \n\ntree, SNPPar searches for SNPs that are the same mutation (e.g., C, G) at the same position in \n\ntwo or more unrelated isolates or different mutations that result in the same base (e.g., C, G, A, \n\nG) in the same position. It also detects revertant mutations back to the ancestral state (e.g. C  G  \n\nC)64.  We  used  the  default  settings  of  SNPPar,  which  is  a  TreeTime  for  ancestral  state \n\n13 \n\n \n\nreconstruction (ASR). As input, the phylogenies mentioned above were used together with the \n\nH37Rv reference genome in Genbank format (NC_000962.3) and an SNP position file. On the \n\nlarge dataset of 31,428 publicly available samples, SNPPar was run 8 times on 8 independent \n\nsets of isolates corresponding to 8 genetic backgrounds (L1–L6). Lineage sample counts are as \n\nfollows:  L1: 2,815;  L2: 8,090;  L3: 3,398;  L4A: 5,839;  L4B: 6,958;  L4C: 4,134;  L5: 98;  and \n\nL6: 96. \n\nMapping of the nSNPs on the ESX-1 predicted models \n\nAlphaFold2-generated  protein  3D  models  were  collected  from  the  EBI/AlphaFold \n\ncollection of models built upon the UniProt database (version 4, last accessed in 20/7/2022, \n\navailable at https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk), using their corresponding UniProt reference. For each \n\nmodel, pLDDT scores per amino-acid position were extracted from the coordinates files (b-\n\nfactor column), and nSNP counts per amino acid were assigned into corresponding attribute \n\nfiles  prior  to  their  rendering  with  UCSF  Chimera  1.1565  and/or  ChimeraX  1.6.166  with  the \n\nfollowing colouring scheme: blue for 0 or yellow >0 SNPs, red for the 1% outliers (>300 SNPs). \n\nnSNPs vs pLDDT vs IDR plots \n\nPutative IDRs of the 34 ESX-1 proteins of interest (POIs) were predicted in batch using \n\nthe OdiNPred server (Prediction of Order and Disorder by evaluation of NMR data, https://st-\n\nprotein.chem.au.dk/odinpred)  without  evolution;  the  disorder  probability  (DP)  scores  were \n\nretained for further processing. nSNP counts, pLDDT scores, and DP scores were assigned to \n\neach amino acid position, per POI, and DP scores were normalised to percentage values for \n\nplotting  purposes.  Figures  were  generated  with  SigmaPlot  12.5  (Systat  Software):  nSNPs \n\ncounts  per  amino  acid  were  displayed  on  a  logarithmic  scale  (0.1  to  40000,  left  axis)  while \n\npLDDT and DP scores per amino acid were displayed on a percentage scale (0 to 100, right \n\naxis). \n\nExpression and purification of EsxA-EsxB wild type and E68K mutant \n\nPlasmid pET29-EsxB-EsxA-6xHis used for expressing wild type EsxAB was a gift from \n\nLalita  Ramakrishnan.  The  single  point  mutation  of  E68K  was  generated  using  site-directed \n\nmutagenesis strategy and confirmed by sequencing. The conditions for expression of both wild \n\ntype and mutant were used as described by Conrad et al. (2017)67. Proteins were purified using \n\nNi2+-Nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen) and a size exclusion chromatography Superdex \n\n75 3.2/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Science) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 150 mM \n\n14 \n\n \n\nNaCl.  Purity  assessment  was  done  by  SDS-PAGE  and  protein  identification  by  mass \n\nspectrometry.  \n\nQuaternary structure analysis \n\nTo  count  SNPs  in  active  sites  residues,  we  used  the  PISA  interface  tool \n\n(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/) to search for residues with Buried Surface value (BSA) >0. \n\nFurthermore,  the  putative  effects  of  point  mutations  on  protein  stability  were  assessed  with \n\nFoldX68 (https://foldxsuite.crg.eu/). \n\nSanger sequencing of espI \n\nTo validate the two espI silent SNPs (Pro134/135Pro), primers were designed for Sanger \n\nsequencing on the DNA extracts of available mutant isolates (i.e., containing the SNPs) and \n\nphylogenetically  closely  related  wild-type  (WT)  isolates.

Therefore, it is of great significance to take One Health approach\nfor understanding the role of MTBC in not only the interfaces of humans\nand animals, but also environment,\nincluding soil, water, pasture, air, and\ndust, etc.,\nin response to the MTBC infection. In this review, we present\nthe evidence of MTBC transmission from environment, as well as detection\nand control strategies in this interface, seeking to provide academic leads\nfor the global goal of End Tuberculosis Strategy under multidisciplinary and\nmultisectoral collaborations.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), one health (OH), environment -\nagriculture, detection method, control & measurement\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) constitutes a significantly\ngenetically similar group of bacteria that cause tuberculosis in a wide range of hosts.\nThey are rod-shaped, acid-base-fast, aerobic, slow-growing intracellular pathogens that\ndestroy phagosomal cells to maintain and evade the immune system (1). The existence\nof MTBC has a long history. In 2001, scientists discovered MTBC in fossil samples of the\nAmerican bison palm from 17,000 years ago and found in the fossils of bighorn sheep\nand musk ox in the same period (2). The major MTBC pathogenic mycobacteria species\ninclude M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti, M. caprae, M. pinnipedii and\nM. canettii (3). Among them, M. tuberculosis is the leading infectious pathogen in the\nworld causing tuberculosis in human, which was first discovered by Robert Koch in 1822\n(4). M. tuberculosis is often present in the sputum of TB patients, thereby contaminating\nthe ground and air. M. bovis, first identified in 1896, is the main causative bacterium of\nbovine tuberculosis. M. bovis has a wider host than M. tuberculosis, and in addition to\ncattle, it exhibits the broad spectrum of host infections, including 50 types of vertebrates\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n01\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nand 25 birds such as badgers, possums, ferrets, red deer, and\nwild boar, etc. (5). Thus, infected animals can contaminate\nthe environment through water sources, soil, etc. Except for\nmembers of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis found a century ago,\nM. africanum was first isolated from the lungs of African\ntuberculosis patients in 1968, and M. canettii was first reported\nin 1969, both of which can cause tuberculosis in humans (6).\nM. microti, M. caprae, and M. pinnipedii were first isolated\nand identified from animals. M. microti was first isolated and\nidentified from voles in 1957 and M. caprae was first isolated\nfrom Spanish goats in 1999. They all may be infectious to\nhumans and other wild animals (7, 8).\n\nThe pathogenesis caused by MTBC is a complex process\ninvolving complex interactions between the host\nimmune\nsystem and bacteria. Generally, humans or animals inhale\ninfectious droplets containing MTBC, which travel along\nthe respiratory tract into terminal alveoli, where they are\nphagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and other phagocytes\n(9). During the initial phase of infection, MTBC is internalized\nby alveolar macrophages, and alveolar macrophages provide\nthe main cellular niche for MTBC to replicate intracellularly.\nThus, while protecting the host from mycobacterial invasion,\nmacrophages also promote the establishment of early MTBC\ninfection and maintain incubation period of infection. Bacteria-\nladen immune cells may be transported across the alveolar\nbarrier\nto cause systemic spread (9). The most\ntypical\npathological manifestation of tuberculosis is the nodular lesions\nobserved in lungs, which are termed tubercles. At present,\ntuberculosis caused by MTBC in humans and animals has been\n13th cause of death and the second leading infectious killer after\nCOVID-19 (above HIV/AIDS) worldwide, critically threatening\nthe health of humans and animals (10).\n\nOne Health approach is to recognize that human health\nis closely related to the animal health, plant health and the\nenvironment they share (11). One Health approach encourages\nthe cross of traditional boundaries of medicine and veterinary\nmedicine. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Louis Pasteur,\nand Robert Koch along with physicians like William Osler and\nRudolf Virchow broke boundaries between animal and human\nhealth, which played a pivotal role on the control of infectious\ndiseases (12). Similarly, One Health approach to tuberculosis\ncontrol requires understanding, monitoring, and control of\nhow tuberculosis spreads between humans, animals, and the\nenvironment. This highlights communication and collaboration\nbetween human health experts such as doctors, animal health\nexperts such as veterinarians, environmental experts such as\necologists, and government and law enforcement agencies (13).\nIn most developed countries, tuberculosis is an almost\ncontrolled disease, but it continues to be a global challenge to\nthe One Health due to the high burden and cost of tuberculosis\nin developing countries (14). In 2020, the 30 high tuberculosis\nburden countries accounted for 86% of new tuberculosis cases.\nEight countries account for two thirds of the total, with India\n\nleading the count, followed by China, Indonesia, the Philippines,\nPakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa. In 2020,\nWHO reported that there were 10 million people infected with\ntuberculosis and 1.5 million died (including 214 000 people with\nHIV) (10). Meanwhile, due to close interaction between human\nand animals, other MTBC species, especially M. bovis, pose a\nzoonotic challenge to the One Health. Although some countries\ndeclare the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, M. bovis is still\nwidespread in most of the developing countries (15). It has been\nestimated that the global prevalence rate of M. bovis infection in\nhuman cases is 12.1% during 2009–2019 (16).\n\nHuman infection with tuberculosis is mainly by inhalation of\ncontaminated droplets from patients and environment, though\nM. bovis infection can be transmitted via uncooked meat,\nunpasteurized milk or occasionally from direct contact with\ninfected livestock or offal (17). Environmental contamination\nof MTBC is somehow implicated to the indirect tuberculosis\ntransmission to humans and animals. It is unraveled that\nMTBC has been widespread in the environment, including\nsoil, water, pasture, air, and dust (18). Markedly, according to\nexperimental studies, MTBC bacteria exhibit strong tolerance\nfor harsh environment for even months (19). Therefore, the\ncontamination of the MTBC may pose a huge threat to not only\nthe environment, but also linked humans and animals. In this\nscenario, this minireview summaries the impacts of the MTBC\nenvironmental contamination on the tuberculosis infection of\nhumans and animals and provides feasible ways for the detection\nand control of the etiologic agents (Figure 1).\n\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis\ncomplex in the environment infects\nhumans and animals worldwide\n\nA multitude of evidence demonstrate that MTBC has been\ndetected from many environmental samples around the world\n(19–21), which suggests that MTBC in the environment, such\nas water sources, soil, etc., represents a potential source of\ninfection detrimental to people and animals. MTBC are released\nfrom infected individuals to the environment via sputum, feces,\nurine, aerosols, etc. (22, 23). Due to the typical structure of\nmycobacteria rich in lipids in cell wall, the strong tolerance of\nMTBC benefits the survival for 10 months in dry sputum and\n5 months in water (24). The long-term viability of MTBC in the\nenvironment increases the risk of exposure to a variety of species\nsharing the same habitat.\n\nIn Asia, captive elephants and wild elephants come\ninto contact when breeding, or share feeding and watering\nareas. Tuberculosis cases have been confirmed among captive\nelephants in Nepal (25), and it is found that 24% of 250 captive\nelephants were serologically positive (26). Similarly in Thailand,\nM. tuberculosis isolated from captive elephants was sequenced\nand strains appeared to have genetically originated from\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n02\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nFIGURE 1\nThe spread of MTBC in the environment. MTBC spreads among farms, wild environment, and human habitats, causing tuberculosis infection in\nhumans and animals.\n\nhumans (27), indicating their living environment is inevitably\ncontaminated. When captive elephants and wild elephants are\nexposed to the same contaminated environment, the risk of\ntuberculosis infection dramatically increases. Since humans and\nelephants share the same habitat, the contamination of MTBC in\nthe environment may be one of the reasons for the high epidemic\nof human tuberculosis among elephant handlers.\n\nSimilarly in Europe and USA, Barasona et al. focus on\nthe habitat of cattle, wild boar, and red deer in Spain and\nPortugal, where tuberculosis is highly prevalent. It is noted\nthat 55.8% of the water points for animal, such as small\nwaterholes, were tested positive for MTBC in mud samples\non the shore, while 8.9% of them were positive in the case\nof water samples (19). This suggested water points contributes\nto potential critical risks for MTBC transmission. In Italy,\nTagliapietra et al. investigated the presence of MTBC in wild\nrodents, water or soil samples collected at wild boar habitat. Of\nnote, the isolates with similar genetic profile were found from\nboth wild rodents and water samples, which were strikingly\nlinked to those previously isolated from wild boars (28). Their\nstudy suggested that contaminated environment, such as at\nanimal aggregation sites, played pivotal roles in the infection of\nMTBC in wild rodents and wild boars. In the United Kingdom\nand Ireland, researchers used GPS collars on cattle and badgers\nto track their activities and found that the direct contact between\ncattle and wild animals is actually fairly limited, indicating\n\nthat direct transmission of tuberculosis may not be the main\nmechanism of interspecies transmission, implying the elevating\npossibility of indirect transmission through a contaminated\nshared environment (29, 30). In Michigan US, there is evidence\nthat MTBC in the environment of feed contaminated by wild\ndeer suffering from tuberculosis can also cause tuberculosis in\ncattle, and this has been further confirmed in the laboratory (31).\nIn Africa, such as Tanzania and Niger, MTBC was also\ndetected in cattle and goat feces, soil, water, dam sediment and\nhousehold dust (32), and some detected lineages were identical\nto the dominant M. tuberculosis lineages in patients, which\nhighlights the risk of transmission from the soil to human (33).\nIn addition to wild environment, built environment\nincluding hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and houses are also\nvulnerable places to contract MTBC from contaminated dust,\nsputum, or common household objects. Studies document that\ninoculating guinea pigs with dust collected from tuberculosis\nwards can cause corresponding infection in guinea pigs, which\nprovide empiric evidence that dust in tuberculosis wards has a\nhigh risk of tuberculosis for human (34). Other studies indicate\nthat dried sputum from a tuberculosis patient placed on a\nhandkerchief, or a blanket for 70 days still lead to tuberculosis\ninfection in guinea pigs (35), which means that MTBC settled\non some common household objects could be re-aerosolized and\nbecome a potential source of infection. Smith et al. suggested\nthat domestic cats contracted MTBC when hunting voles, which\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n03\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nmay be infected MTBC in the environment, increasing the risk\nof transmission to humans (36). All the collected data confirmed\nthat MTBC are circulating among humans, animals, and the\nenvironment they share, which make the One Health approach\nmore difficult to be accomplished worldwide.\n\nDetection of Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis complex from\nenvironmental samples\n\nIt is indicated that susceptible animals can become infected\nin merely 3 weeks of exposure to MTBC-infected pastures\n(37). The detection of the MTBC in the environment helps\nto understand, control, and eradicate tuberculosis, and is\nof great significance for the endorsement of One Health\napproach. However, due to influencing factors such as different\npretreatment methods for diverse kinds of environmental\nsamples, along with typical reagents and sample collection\nmethods employed, there is a lack of standardized and high-\nprecision methods to detect MTBC in the environment. The\nexisting methods for detecting the MTBC in the environment\nmainly fall\ninto four categories: microscopic examination,\nculture-based methods, molecular biology methods, and whole-\ngenome sequencing (WGS) methods.\n\nMost of the environmental samples in the built environment\nare sputum, feces, and fomites from patients, while in the\nfield environment the typical samples are mainly implicated\nto water, soil, and aerosols. For samples such as sputum and\nsoil, after treatment with normal saline or PBS, microscopic\nexamination can be performed for direct smears. In terms\nof water and air samples, filter collection is required before\nmicroscopic examination. Microscopic examination of MTBC is\nusually demonstrated with the classic Ziehl-Neelsen stain (38),\nbut fluorescent acid-fast staining may also be used (39).\n\nThe culture method is considered the gold standard for\nthe identification of MTBC, and environmental samples need\nto be pre-treated before culture to remove impurities and\nother bacteria. First wash with PBS and detergents such\nas 0.375–0.75% hexadecyl pyridinium-chloride HPC, 2–4%\nsodium hydroxide or 5% oxalic acid. The mixture is shaken\nat room temperature for 10–15 min, then neutralized. The\nsuspension is centrifuged and discard the supernatant, and\nthen the pellet is used for culture. For primary isolation,\nthe pellet\nis usually inoculated onto a set of solid egg-\nbased media, such as Lowenstein-Jensen; these media should\ncontain pyruvate or pyruvate and glycerol. Agar-based media\nsuch as Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 or blood-based agar\nmedia can also be selected (40). Cultures were incubated at\n◦\n37\nC for at least 8 weeks. Some hospitals and veterinary\nlaboratories routinely adopt liquid culture systems in which\ngrowth is measured by radiometric or fluorometric methods,\nsuch as mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture.\n\nThe culture method proved to be the reliable, but\nthe\nculture method is relatively time-consuming, and the culture\nof MTBC needs to be carried out\nin a biosafety level\n3 laboratory.\n\nsuch as\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (RT-\nPCR) for rapid identification of MTBC targeting 16S rRNA,\ninsert sequences IS6110 and IS1081, and genes encoding\nMTBC-specific proteins, such as MPB70 have been applied\n(41, 42). Several commercially available kits and various\n“in-house” methods have been involved in the detection\nof MTBC in the environment,\nsemiautomated\nPCR test GeneXpert which are effective in reducing cross-\ncontamination of samples. These methods have been shown\nto be rapid and highly sensitive, however, due to the complex\ncontents in environmental samples as well as a relatively\nitself, PCR\nsmall amount of MTBC in the environment\nmethods suffer from variability and low reproducibility (43).\nIn addition, PCR-based assays are unable to distinguish live\nfrom dead bacteria. In response to this limitation, many\nstudies have tried RNA molecules (especially 16S RNA) or\nselective intracellular DNA detection to solve this problem (44,\n45).\n\ncharacterize\n\nidentify different MTBC strains\n\nSpecific identification and genotyping of MTBC are\nconsidered important means for understanding transmission\namong humans, animals, and the environment."}]}

As for indoor\nenvironments such as hospitals and prisons, aerosols are still\nthe major way to spread tuberculosis. The primary mean of\nair disinfection is natural ventilation which has the advantage\nof wide availability, low cost, and high efficacy. In 10 studies\nevaluating environmental\nincluding 31,776\nhuman participants, mechanical ventilation reduced infections\nby 2.9 to 14% (50). However, ventilation depends on the optimal\nclimates (51), upper-room ultraviolet germicidal\nirradiation\n(UVGI) can be supplemented as additional intervention in\nareas where adequate ventilation is difficult to achieve (52).\nThe evaluation of the working parameters of the UVGI system\nclearly shows that the UVGI system can kill or inactivate\nairborne MTBC and significantly enhance the protection of\nhealthcare workers.\n\ninterventions,\n\nIn pastures, especially cattle farms, there is high possibility\nof the contamination with feces, droplets, and nasal mucus.\nThis untreated manure potentially increases the risk of indirect\ntransmission of tuberculosis (53). Therefore, comprehensive\nimplementation of disinfection is an effective way to control\nMTBC in the environment (43). For the entire farm, two or\nthree kinds of disinfectants, such as ethyl alcohol and sodium\nhypochlorite, are utilized alternately to thoroughly disinfect\nthe grounds, shelters, appliances, imports and exports, vehicles,\nexcrement, etc., which can cut off the infection routes and\nprevent the spread of MTBC in animal facilities.\n\nRoutine disinfection is also essential to control the spread\nof MTBC from environment\nto humans and animals. A\npermanent disinfection channel should be set up at high-risk\nregions, particularly, such as the entrance of the farm, so\nthat personnel, vehicles, and materials can be appropriately\ndisinfected especially when entering and leaving the farm.\nEffective disinfectant, such as 20% lime milk, can be applied\nin the disinfection channel. To ensure the actual effect of\nthe disinfectant, replacement is required every 15 days. The\nsurrounding environment of the cowshed (including the sports\nfield) shall be disinfected with 2% sodium hydroxide or\nsprinkled with quicklime once a week. Sewage tanks, cesspits,\nand sewer outlets shall be disinfected with bleaching powder\nonce a month. All utensils in the barn should be disinfected\nregularly. The delivery room should be disinfected once a\nweek besides immediate disinfection before and after delivery.\n\nMilking staff, milking machines and other tools must be cleaned\nand disinfected every time. Additionally, it should be noted\nthat contamination of milk by disinfectants may occur during\nenvironmental disinfection in the milking parlor.\n\nThe environment contamination by wild animals may also\nplay an important role in tuberculosis epidemiology. It is\nbelieved transmission and infection occur through the shedding\nof infectious bacilli of animals, and this phenomenon is well-\ndescribed in badgers, wild boars, and deer (23, 54, 55). However,\neradication of MTBC in wild environment seems to be extremely\nimpossible. In the United Kingdom, immunization of badgers\nwith the BCG vaccine provides immune protection to badgers\nand is an option for reducing MTBC in the environment, playing\na role in the transmission of MTBC at the wildlife and livestock\ninterface. Another effective measure is to prevent wild animals\nfrom contaminating the living environment shared with humans\nand domestic animals. For example, feasible measures include\nthe use of anti-badger fencing, raised outdoor water and feed\ntroughs which preclude access for badgers (56).\n\nOne health prospects\n\nCurrently, human and animal tuberculosis control programs\nhave been implemented under normal conditions. Under the\nlong-term efforts of WHO, OIE, FAO and the European Union,\nthe joint aim is to reduce the percentage of tuberculosis deaths\nby 95% and the incidence of tuberculosis by 90% by 2035\ncompared with 2015 (57). However, the continued presence\nof MTBC in the environment is a challenge to One Health,\nmaking it a potential barrier to the 2035 target. Meanwhile,\nthe treatment of tuberculosis acquired from the environment\nand the monitoring of tuberculosis in the environment also\nimpose a huge burden on the economy. Research on tuberculosis\ntransmission has mainly focused on the transmission between\nhosts, while epidemiological investigations of MTBC in the\nenvironment are less addressed. However, many studies and\nanimal experiments have shown that MTBC exists in both\nnatural and indoor environments, and MTBC in some of these\nenvironments, may still be contagious (58). This leads to a\npotentially underestimated MTBC burden in the environment,\nwhich is one of the reasons for neglect in environmental MTBC.\nTherefore, One Health approach enhances the awareness\nof the prevention and control of MTBC in the environment,\ndemonstrating an essential way to the goal of End Tuberculosis\nStrategy (59). On the one hand, medical staff and animal\nhusbandry practitioners abide by relevant regulations and laws\non epidemic prevention in the process of medical treatment,\nbreeding, and sales, and do a good job in environmental\ndisinfection to avoid the spread of MTBC (50). On the other\nhand, the government and tuberculosis prevention and control\ninstitutions should enhance the subjective perception that\nMTBC in the environment harms the human and animal health\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n05\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\nZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nand pay adequate attention to the MTBC in the environment\ncausing tuberculosis (60). At the national level, the government\nneeds to establish a feasible MTBC monitoring and prevention\nsystem in the environment. The health department should\nclosely monitor the disinfection records of medical and health\ninstitutions, and the animal epidemic prevention department\nshould closely monitor the disinfection situation of farms and\nother environments, conduct joint monitoring of key areas, and\nattach attention to the prevalence and spread of MTBC among\nanimals and humans in the environment (61).\n\nAt the national\n\nlevel, the government needs to initiate\nMTBC monitoring and prevention system in the environment.\nThe health department should closely monitor the disinfection\nrecords of medical and health institutions. In addition to the\nharm of MTBC infection itself, in a high-risk environment\nthe most\ncontaminated by MTBC, HIV co-infection is\nimportant risk factor for the development of latent tuberculosis\ninto active tuberculosis (62). In the meantime, MTBC infection\nfrom the environment can also negatively affect the immune\nresponse to HIV, accelerating the progression of HIV infection\nto AIDS (63). Animal epidemic prevention departments\nshould closely monitor the disinfection of farms and other\nenvironments. MTBC in the environment will not only threaten\nanimal health, but also be directly or indirectly exposed to\nantibiotics during treatment. It should be noted that drug-\nresistant MTBC pose an uncontrollable threat to the treatment\nand decontamination of tuberculosis (64). Joint monitoring of\nhealth and animal epidemic prevention departments should\nbe carried out in key areas contaminated by MTBC, and the\nprevalence and spread of MTBC among animals and humans in\nthe environment should be closely monitored.\n\nit\n\nFor\n\nand\n\ninstitutes\n\ntuberculosis\n\nlaboratories,\n\nis\nnecessary to strengthen scientific research on MTBC in\nenvironment, develop molecular biology detection\nthe\ntechnologies, and improve\nthe accuracy and timeliness\nof MTBC detection in the environment (65).
