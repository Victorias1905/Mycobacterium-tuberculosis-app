Therefore, it is of great signiﬁcance to take One Health approach\nfor understanding the role of MTBC in not only the interfaces of humans\nand animals, but also environment,\nincluding soil, water, pasture, air, and\ndust, etc.,\nin response to the MTBC infection. In this review, we present\nthe evidence of MTBC transmission from environment, as well as detection\nand control strategies in this interface, seeking to provide academic leads\nfor the global goal of End Tuberculosis Strategy under multidisciplinary and\nmultisectoral collaborations.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), one health (OH), environment -\nagriculture, detection method, control & measurement\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) constitutes a signiﬁcantly\ngenetically similar group of bacteria that cause tuberculosis in a wide range of hosts.\nThey are rod-shaped, acid-base-fast, aerobic, slow-growing intracellular pathogens that\ndestroy phagosomal cells to maintain and evade the immune system (1). The existence\nof MTBC has a long history. In 2001, scientists discovered MTBC in fossil samples of the\nAmerican bison palm from 17,000 years ago and found in the fossils of bighorn sheep\nand musk ox in the same period (2). The major MTBC pathogenic mycobacteria species\ninclude M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti, M. caprae, M. pinnipedii and\nM. canettii (3). Among them, M. tuberculosis is the leading infectious pathogen in the\nworld causing tuberculosis in human, which was ﬁrst discovered by Robert Koch in 1822\n(4). M. tuberculosis is often present in the sputum of TB patients, thereby contaminating\nthe ground and air. M. bovis, ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1896, is the main causative bacterium of\nbovine tuberculosis. M. bovis has a wider host than M. tuberculosis, and in addition to\ncattle, it exhibits the broad spectrum of host infections, including 50 types of vertebrates\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n01\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nand 25 birds such as badgers, possums, ferrets, red deer, and\nwild boar, etc. (5). Thus, infected animals can contaminate\nthe environment through water sources, soil, etc. Except for\nmembers of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis found a century ago,\nM. africanum was ﬁrst isolated from the lungs of African\ntuberculosis patients in 1968, and M. canettii was ﬁrst reported\nin 1969, both of which can cause tuberculosis in humans (6).\nM. microti, M. caprae, and M. pinnipedii were ﬁrst isolated\nand identiﬁed from animals. M. microti was ﬁrst isolated and\nidentiﬁed from voles in 1957 and M. caprae was ﬁrst isolated\nfrom Spanish goats in 1999. They all may be infectious to\nhumans and other wild animals (7, 8).\n\nThe pathogenesis caused by MTBC is a complex process\ninvolving complex interactions between the host\nimmune\nsystem and bacteria. Generally, humans or animals inhale\ninfectious droplets containing MTBC, which travel along\nthe respiratory tract into terminal alveoli, where they are\nphagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and other phagocytes\n(9). During the initial phase of infection, MTBC is internalized\nby alveolar macrophages, and alveolar macrophages provide\nthe main cellular niche for MTBC to replicate intracellularly.\nThus, while protecting the host from mycobacterial invasion,\nmacrophages also promote the establishment of early MTBC\ninfection and maintain incubation period of infection. Bacteria-\nladen immune cells may be transported across the alveolar\nbarrier\nto cause systemic spread (9). The most\ntypical\npathological manifestation of tuberculosis is the nodular lesions\nobserved in lungs, which are termed tubercles. At present,\ntuberculosis caused by MTBC in humans and animals has been\n13th cause of death and the second leading infectious killer after\nCOVID-19 (above HIV/AIDS) worldwide, critically threatening\nthe health of humans and animals (10).\n\nOne Health approach is to recognize that human health\nis closely related to the animal health, plant health and the\nenvironment they share (11). One Health approach encourages\nthe cross of traditional boundaries of medicine and veterinary\nmedicine. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Louis Pasteur,\nand Robert Koch along with physicians like William Osler and\nRudolf Virchow broke boundaries between animal and human\nhealth, which played a pivotal role on the control of infectious\ndiseases (12). Similarly, One Health approach to tuberculosis\ncontrol requires understanding, monitoring, and control of\nhow tuberculosis spreads between humans, animals, and the\nenvironment. This highlights communication and collaboration\nbetween human health experts such as doctors, animal health\nexperts such as veterinarians, environmental experts such as\necologists, and government and law enforcement agencies (13).\nIn most developed countries, tuberculosis is an almost\ncontrolled disease, but it continues to be a global challenge to\nthe One Health due to the high burden and cost of tuberculosis\nin developing countries (14). In 2020, the 30 high tuberculosis\nburden countries accounted for 86% of new tuberculosis cases.\nEight countries account for two thirds of the total, with India\n\nleading the count, followed by China, Indonesia, the Philippines,\nPakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa. In 2020,\nWHO reported that there were 10 million people infected with\ntuberculosis and 1.5 million died (including 214 000 people with\nHIV) (10). Meanwhile, due to close interaction between human\nand animals, other MTBC species, especially M. bovis, pose a\nzoonotic challenge to the One Health. Although some countries\ndeclare the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, M. bovis is still\nwidespread in most of the developing countries (15). It has been\nestimated that the global prevalence rate of M. bovis infection in\nhuman cases is 12.1% during 2009–2019 (16).\n\nHuman infection with tuberculosis is mainly by inhalation of\ncontaminated droplets from patients and environment, though\nM. bovis infection can be transmitted via uncooked meat,\nunpasteurized milk or occasionally from direct contact with\ninfected livestock or oﬀal (17). Environmental contamination\nof MTBC is somehow implicated to the indirect tuberculosis\ntransmission to humans and animals. It is unraveled that\nMTBC has been widespread in the environment, including\nsoil, water, pasture, air, and dust (18). Markedly, according to\nexperimental studies, MTBC bacteria exhibit strong tolerance\nfor harsh environment for even months (19). Therefore, the\ncontamination of the MTBC may pose a huge threat to not only\nthe environment, but also linked humans and animals. In this\nscenario, this minireview summaries the impacts of the MTBC\nenvironmental contamination on the tuberculosis infection of\nhumans and animals and provides feasible ways for the detection\nand control of the etiologic agents (Figure 1).\n\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis\ncomplex in the environment infects\nhumans and animals worldwide\n\nA multitude of evidence demonstrate that MTBC has been\ndetected from many environmental samples around the world\n(19–21), which suggests that MTBC in the environment, such\nas water sources, soil, etc., represents a potential source of\ninfection detrimental to people and animals. MTBC are released\nfrom infected individuals to the environment via sputum, feces,\nurine, aerosols, etc. (22, 23). Due to the typical structure of\nmycobacteria rich in lipids in cell wall, the strong tolerance of\nMTBC beneﬁts the survival for 10 months in dry sputum and\n5 months in water (24). The long-term viability of MTBC in the\nenvironment increases the risk of exposure to a variety of species\nsharing the same habitat.\n\nIn Asia, captive elephants and wild elephants come\ninto contact when breeding, or share feeding and watering\nareas. Tuberculosis cases have been conﬁrmed among captive\nelephants in Nepal (25), and it is found that 24% of 250 captive\nelephants were serologically positive (26). Similarly in Thailand,\nM. tuberculosis isolated from captive elephants was sequenced\nand strains appeared to have genetically originated from\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n02\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nFIGURE 1\nThe spread of MTBC in the environment. MTBC spreads among farms, wild environment, and human habitats, causing tuberculosis infection in\nhumans and animals.\n\nhumans (27), indicating their living environment is inevitably\ncontaminated. When captive elephants and wild elephants are\nexposed to the same contaminated environment, the risk of\ntuberculosis infection dramatically increases. Since humans and\nelephants share the same habitat, the contamination of MTBC in\nthe environment may be one of the reasons for the high epidemic\nof human tuberculosis among elephant handlers.\n\nSimilarly in Europe and USA, Barasona et al. focus on\nthe habitat of cattle, wild boar, and red deer in Spain and\nPortugal, where tuberculosis is highly prevalent. It is noted\nthat 55.8% of the water points for animal, such as small\nwaterholes, were tested positive for MTBC in mud samples\non the shore, while 8.9% of them were positive in the case\nof water samples (19). This suggested water points contributes\nto potential critical risks for MTBC transmission. In Italy,\nTagliapietra et al. investigated the presence of MTBC in wild\nrodents, water or soil samples collected at wild boar habitat. Of\nnote, the isolates with similar genetic proﬁle were found from\nboth wild rodents and water samples, which were strikingly\nlinked to those previously isolated from wild boars (28). Their\nstudy suggested that contaminated environment, such as at\nanimal aggregation sites, played pivotal roles in the infection of\nMTBC in wild rodents and wild boars. In the United Kingdom\nand Ireland, researchers used GPS collars on cattle and badgers\nto track their activities and found that the direct contact between\ncattle and wild animals is actually fairly limited, indicating\n\nthat direct transmission of tuberculosis may not be the main\nmechanism of interspecies transmission, implying the elevating\npossibility of indirect transmission through a contaminated\nshared environment (29, 30). In Michigan US, there is evidence\nthat MTBC in the environment of feed contaminated by wild\ndeer suﬀering from tuberculosis can also cause tuberculosis in\ncattle, and this has been further conﬁrmed in the laboratory (31).\nIn Africa, such as Tanzania and Niger, MTBC was also\ndetected in cattle and goat feces, soil, water, dam sediment and\nhousehold dust (32), and some detected lineages were identical\nto the dominant M. tuberculosis lineages in patients, which\nhighlights the risk of transmission from the soil to human (33).\nIn addition to wild environment, built environment\nincluding hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and houses are also\nvulnerable places to contract MTBC from contaminated dust,\nsputum, or common household objects. Studies document that\ninoculating guinea pigs with dust collected from tuberculosis\nwards can cause corresponding infection in guinea pigs, which\nprovide empiric evidence that dust in tuberculosis wards has a\nhigh risk of tuberculosis for human (34). Other studies indicate\nthat dried sputum from a tuberculosis patient placed on a\nhandkerchief, or a blanket for 70 days still lead to tuberculosis\ninfection in guinea pigs (35), which means that MTBC settled\non some common household objects could be re-aerosolized and\nbecome a potential source of infection. Smith et al. suggested\nthat domestic cats contracted MTBC when hunting voles, which\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n03\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nmay be infected MTBC in the environment, increasing the risk\nof transmission to humans (36). All the collected data conﬁrmed\nthat MTBC are circulating among humans, animals, and the\nenvironment they share, which make the One Health approach\nmore diﬃcult to be accomplished worldwide.\n\nDetection of Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis complex from\nenvironmental samples\n\nIt is indicated that susceptible animals can become infected\nin merely 3 weeks of exposure to MTBC-infected pastures\n(37). The detection of the MTBC in the environment helps\nto understand, control, and eradicate tuberculosis, and is\nof great signiﬁcance for the endorsement of One Health\napproach. However, due to inﬂuencing factors such as diﬀerent\npretreatment methods for diverse kinds of environmental\nsamples, along with typical reagents and sample collection\nmethods employed, there is a lack of standardized and high-\nprecision methods to detect MTBC in the environment. The\nexisting methods for detecting the MTBC in the environment\nmainly fall\ninto four categories: microscopic examination,\nculture-based methods, molecular biology methods, and whole-\ngenome sequencing (WGS) methods.\n\nMost of the environmental samples in the built environment\nare sputum, feces, and fomites from patients, while in the\nﬁeld environment the typical samples are mainly implicated\nto water, soil, and aerosols. For samples such as sputum and\nsoil, after treatment with normal saline or PBS, microscopic\nexamination can be performed for direct smears. In terms\nof water and air samples, ﬁlter collection is required before\nmicroscopic examination. Microscopic examination of MTBC is\nusually demonstrated with the classic Ziehl-Neelsen stain (38),\nbut ﬂuorescent acid-fast staining may also be used (39).\n\nThe culture method is considered the gold standard for\nthe identiﬁcation of MTBC, and environmental samples need\nto be pre-treated before culture to remove impurities and\nother bacteria. First wash with PBS and detergents such\nas 0.375–0.75% hexadecyl pyridinium-chloride HPC, 2–4%\nsodium hydroxide or 5% oxalic acid. The mixture is shaken\nat room temperature for 10–15 min, then neutralized. The\nsuspension is centrifuged and discard the supernatant, and\nthen the pellet is used for culture. For primary isolation,\nthe pellet\nis usually inoculated onto a set of solid egg-\nbased media, such as Lowenstein-Jensen; these media should\ncontain pyruvate or pyruvate and glycerol. Agar-based media\nsuch as Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 or blood-based agar\nmedia can also be selected (40). Cultures were incubated at\n◦\n37\nC for at least 8 weeks. Some hospitals and veterinary\nlaboratories routinely adopt liquid culture systems in which\ngrowth is measured by radiometric or ﬂuorometric methods,\nsuch as mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture.\n\nThe culture method proved to be the reliable, but\nthe\nculture method is relatively time-consuming, and the culture\nof MTBC needs to be carried out\nin a biosafety level\n3 laboratory.\n\nsuch as\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (RT-\nPCR) for rapid identiﬁcation of MTBC targeting 16S rRNA,\ninsert sequences IS6110 and IS1081, and genes encoding\nMTBC-speciﬁc proteins, such as MPB70 have been applied\n(41, 42). Several commercially available kits and various\n“in-house” methods have been involved in the detection\nof MTBC in the environment,\nsemiautomated\nPCR test GeneXpert which are eﬀective in reducing cross-\ncontamination of samples. These methods have been shown\nto be rapid and highly sensitive, however, due to the complex\ncontents in environmental samples as well as a relatively\nitself, PCR\nsmall amount of MTBC in the environment\nmethods suﬀer from variability and low reproducibility (43).\nIn addition, PCR-based assays are unable to distinguish live\nfrom dead bacteria. In response to this limitation, many\nstudies have tried RNA molecules (especially 16S RNA) or\nselective intracellular DNA detection to solve this problem (44,\n45).\n\ncharacterize\n\nidentify diﬀerent MTBC strains\n\nSpeciﬁc identiﬁcation and genotyping of MTBC are\nconsidered important means for understanding transmission\namong humans, animals, and the environment. Various\ngenotyping techniques have been developed to distinguish\nMTBC isolates from shared environment. These methods\nand will\ncan further\nenable\nspread and mode of\ntransmission of MTBC (46). The most widely used\nmethods\n24-loci MIRU-VNTR\ntyping. Spoligotyping can distinguish strains belonging to\nthe interior of MTBC and MIRU-VNTR typing will enable\nsigniﬁcantly enrich our knowledge of MTBC phylogeny and\nglobal spread. However, in some cases, their discriminating\ninvestigations may\npower for prospective epidemiological\nbe restricted.\n\nspoligotyping\n\nthe origin,\n\nand\n\nare\n\nsaving time,\n\nThe rapid development of whole-genome sequencing\n(WGS)\nincluding next-generation sequencing and long-\nread technology sequencing has made it possible to identify\ngenetic information of MTBC in environmental samples.\nWGS can sequence complete genomes of multiple strains\nsimultaneously,\nstreamlining workﬂow, and\nprovide more information than traditional methods (47).\nin\nWGS resequencing allows\nMTBC based on known reference genomes,\nfacilitating\ninvestigations\nmolecular\nof MTBC in\nstudies have used WGS in\nthe\nepidemiological surveys, shown that WGS provides better\ndiscriminative performance and improved accuracy compared\nto traditional methods (48, 49).\nImportantly, by directly\nit potentially oﬀers a cost-\nanalyzing the MTBC genome,\neﬀective way for public health teams. In the future, WGS is\n\nepidemiological\nenvironment. Several\n\nto identify polymorphisms\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n04\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\npromisingly as one of the main methods to detect MTBC in\nthe environment.\n\nEnvironmental control measures for\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\ncomplex\n\nMinimizing the MTBC in the environment using One\nHealth approach helps protect human and animal health.\nEstablishing an eﬀective disinfection system is\nthe key\nto controlling MTBC in the environment. As for indoor\nenvironments such as hospitals and prisons, aerosols are still\nthe major way to spread tuberculosis. The primary mean of\nair disinfection is natural ventilation which has the advantage\nof wide availability, low cost, and high eﬃcacy. In 10 studies\nevaluating environmental\nincluding 31,776\nhuman participants, mechanical ventilation reduced infections\nby 2.9 to 14% (50). However, ventilation depends on the optimal\nclimates (51), upper-room ultraviolet germicidal\nirradiation\n(UVGI) can be supplemented as additional intervention in\nareas where adequate ventilation is diﬃcult to achieve (52).\nThe evaluation of the working parameters of the UVGI system\nclearly shows that the UVGI system can kill or inactivate\nairborne MTBC and signiﬁcantly enhance the protection of\nhealthcare workers.\n\ninterventions,\n\nIn pastures, especially cattle farms, there is high possibility\nof the contamination with feces, droplets, and nasal mucus.\nThis untreated manure potentially increases the risk of indirect\ntransmission of tuberculosis (53). Therefore, comprehensive\nimplementation of disinfection is an eﬀective way to control\nMTBC in the environment (43). For the entire farm, two or\nthree kinds of disinfectants, such as ethyl alcohol and sodium\nhypochlorite, are utilized alternately to thoroughly disinfect\nthe grounds, shelters, appliances, imports and exports, vehicles,\nexcrement, etc., which can cut oﬀ the infection routes and\nprevent the spread of MTBC in animal facilities.\n\nRoutine disinfection is also essential to control the spread\nof MTBC from environment\nto humans and animals. A\npermanent disinfection channel should be set up at high-risk\nregions, particularly, such as the entrance of the farm, so\nthat personnel, vehicles, and materials can be appropriately\ndisinfected especially when entering and leaving the farm.\nEﬀective disinfectant, such as 20% lime milk, can be applied\nin the disinfection channel. To ensure the actual eﬀect of\nthe disinfectant, replacement is required every 15 days. The\nsurrounding environment of the cowshed (including the sports\nﬁeld) shall be disinfected with 2% sodium hydroxide or\nsprinkled with quicklime once a week. Sewage tanks, cesspits,\nand sewer outlets shall be disinfected with bleaching powder\nonce a month. All utensils in the barn should be disinfected\nregularly. The delivery room should be disinfected once a\nweek besides immediate disinfection before and after delivery.\n\nMilking staﬀ, milking machines and other tools must be cleaned\nand disinfected every time. Additionally, it should be noted\nthat contamination of milk by disinfectants may occur during\nenvironmental disinfection in the milking parlor.\n\nThe environment contamination by wild animals may also\nplay an important role in tuberculosis epidemiology. It is\nbelieved transmission and infection occur through the shedding\nof infectious bacilli of animals, and this phenomenon is well-\ndescribed in badgers, wild boars, and deer (23, 54, 55). However,\neradication of MTBC in wild environment seems to be extremely\nimpossible. In the United Kingdom, immunization of badgers\nwith the BCG vaccine provides immune protection to badgers\nand is an option for reducing MTBC in the environment, playing\na role in the transmission of MTBC at the wildlife and livestock\ninterface. Another eﬀective measure is to prevent wild animals\nfrom contaminating the living environment shared with humans\nand domestic animals. For example, feasible measures include\nthe use of anti-badger fencing, raised outdoor water and feed\ntroughs which preclude access for badgers (56).\n\nOne health prospects\n\nCurrently, human and animal tuberculosis control programs\nhave been implemented under normal conditions. Under the\nlong-term eﬀorts of WHO, OIE, FAO and the European Union,\nthe joint aim is to reduce the percentage of tuberculosis deaths\nby 95% and the incidence of tuberculosis by 90% by 2035\ncompared with 2015 (57). However, the continued presence\nof MTBC in the environment is a challenge to One Health,\nmaking it a potential barrier to the 2035 target. Meanwhile,\nthe treatment of tuberculosis acquired from the environment\nand the monitoring of tuberculosis in the environment also\nimpose a huge burden on the economy. Research on tuberculosis\ntransmission has mainly focused on the transmission between\nhosts, while epidemiological investigations of MTBC in the\nenvironment are less addressed. However, many studies and\nanimal experiments have shown that MTBC exists in both\nnatural and indoor environments, and MTBC in some of these\nenvironments, may still be contagious (58). This leads to a\npotentially underestimated MTBC burden in the environment,\nwhich is one of the reasons for neglect in environmental MTBC.\nTherefore, One Health approach enhances the awareness\nof the prevention and control of MTBC in the environment,\ndemonstrating an essential way to the goal of End Tuberculosis\nStrategy (59). On the one hand, medical staﬀ and animal\nhusbandry practitioners abide by relevant regulations and laws\non epidemic prevention in the process of medical treatment,\nbreeding, and sales, and do a good job in environmental\ndisinfection to avoid the spread of MTBC (50). On the other\nhand, the government and tuberculosis prevention and control\ninstitutions should enhance the subjective perception that\nMTBC in the environment harms the human and animal health\n\nFrontiers in Public Health\n\n05\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fZhang et al.\n\n10.3389/fpubh.2022.994745\n\nand pay adequate attention to the MTBC in the environment\ncausing tuberculosis (60). At the national level, the government\nneeds to establish a feasible MTBC monitoring and prevention\nsystem in the environment. The health department should\nclosely monitor the disinfection records of medical and health\ninstitutions, and the animal epidemic prevention department\nshould closely monitor the disinfection situation of farms and\nother environments, conduct joint monitoring of key areas, and\nattach attention to the prevalence and spread of MTBC among\nanimals and humans in the environment (61).\n\nAt the national\n\nlevel, the government needs to initiate\nMTBC monitoring and prevention system in the environment.\nThe health department should closely monitor the disinfection\nrecords of medical and health institutions. In addition to the\nharm of MTBC infection itself, in a high-risk environment\nthe most\ncontaminated by MTBC, HIV co-infection is\nimportant risk factor for the development of latent tuberculosis\ninto active tuberculosis (62). In the meantime, MTBC infection\nfrom the environment can also negatively aﬀect the immune\nresponse to HIV, accelerating the progression of HIV infection\nto AIDS (63). Animal epidemic prevention departments\nshould closely monitor the disinfection of farms and other\nenvironments. MTBC in the environment will not only threaten\nanimal health, but also be directly or indirectly exposed to\nantibiotics during treatment. It should be noted that drug-\nresistant MTBC pose an uncontrollable threat to the treatment\nand decontamination of tuberculosis (64). Joint monitoring of\nhealth and animal epidemic prevention departments should\nbe carried out in key areas contaminated by MTBC, and the\nprevalence and spread of MTBC among animals and humans in\nthe environment should be closely monitored.\n\nit\n\nFor\n\nand\n\ninstitutes\n\ntuberculosis\n\nlaboratories,\n\nis\nnecessary to strengthen scientiﬁc research on MTBC in\nenvironment, develop molecular biology detection\nthe\ntechnologies, and improve\nthe accuracy and timeliness\nof MTBC detection in the environment (65).
